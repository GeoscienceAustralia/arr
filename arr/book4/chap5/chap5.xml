  <title>Treatment of Joint Probability</title>

  <section>
    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>all problems in flood estimation are joint probability, with
    rainfall is the main driver so we traditionally dumb it down. joint
    probability is more important when you're after more than just the
    peak</para>

    <title>When you need JP</title>

    <para>Examples of when you would use it</para>

    <para>stochastic inputs</para>

    <para>sensitivity testing of one component at a time to demonstrate that a
    median or single representative value cannot be used.</para>

    <title>Application of Joint Probability</title>

    <para>not just looking at peak</para>

    <para>at a junction</para>

    <para>not completely dominated by a single variable</para>

    <para>Monte Carlo is needed with greater than 2 variables</para>

    <para>Eric Laurance, WRR 1973</para>

    <para>Continuous Simulation</para>

    <para>2 variable numerical integration</para>

    <para>when Monte Carlo fails to converge</para>

    <section>
      <title>Examples</title>

      <para>conceptual problems and solution approaches</para>

      <para>the purpose of these examples is to show how to solve these sort
      of problems and not to go into the mechanics</para>
