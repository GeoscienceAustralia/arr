    <title>Event Modelling Systems</title>
    
    <para>The various concepts associated with application of event models will
        be presented in this section. Included will be specific details of the
        assumptions inherent in the application, namely the need for parameters that
        ensure frequency transformation with single burst simulation and the need
        for frequency analysis of predictions from the Monte-Carlo simulation.
        Detailed in the second and third sections will be specific details necessary
        for application of the relevant methods, and the advantages and
        disadvantages of both approaches.</para>
