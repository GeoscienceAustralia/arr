  <title>Alternative Approaches</title>

  <para>The first section of this chapter needs to introduce the conceptual
  model of design flood estimation techniques - this will be an expansion of
  the initial sections of the IAHR paper on revisiting the design flood
  problem. Included in this section therefore is the presentation of the
  design flood problem as a data mining problem (i.e. a hydroinformatic
  problem) where a statistical model is fitted to relevant data; this data can
  be the result of field monitoring, regional regression, or catchment
  simulation. This needs to be carefully framed as it forms the foundation of
  the approach being adopted in later sections.</para>
