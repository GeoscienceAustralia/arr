         <para>This is the most common method of selecting the floods to be
            analysed in Flood Frequency Analysis. The series is comprised of the
            highest instantaneous rate of discharge in each year of record. The year
            may be a calendar year or a water year, the latter usually commencing at
            the end of the period of lowest average discharge during the year. The
            highest discharge in each year is selected whether it is a major flood or
            not, and all other floods are neglected, even though some will be much
            larger than the maximum discharges selected from some other years. For N
            years of data, the annual flood series will consist of N values.</para>
