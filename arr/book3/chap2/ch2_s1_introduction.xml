  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>Flood Frequency Analysis (FFA) refers to procedures that use recorded and related flood data
    to identify underlying probability model of flood peaks, at a particular location in the
    catchment, which can then be used to perform risk-based design and flood risk assessment, while
    providing input to regional flood estimation methods.</para>

  <para>The primary purpose of this chapter is to present guidelines on performing Flood Frequency Analyses<footnote>
      <para>The chapter represents a substantial revision of Chapter 10 of the
          3<superscript>rd</superscript> Edition of Australian Rainfall and Runoff (Pilgrim and
        Doran, 1987). Where appropriate, original contribution by Pilgrim and Doran has been
        retained. Major changes include introduction of non-homogeneous probability models,
        replacement of product log-moments with more efficient estimation methods, use of Bayesian
        methods to make better use of available flood information (such as censored flow data,
        rating curve error and regional information), reduced prescription about the choice of flood
        probability model, improved identification of potentially influential low flows and guidance
        on fitting frequency curves to “difficult” data sets.</para>
    </footnote>.Often judgment will need to be exercised when applying these techniques. To inform
    such judgments, this chapter describes the key conceptual foundations that underpin Flood
    Frequency Analysis – the practitioner will need an understanding of elementary probability
    theory and statistics to get maximum benefit. In addition, a number of worked examples are
    provided to aid deeper insight with the implied caveat that the examples are not exhaustive in
    their scope. While it is expected that most practitioners will use software written by others to
    implement the methods described in this chapter, sufficient information is provided to enable
    practitioners to develop their own software applications.</para>
