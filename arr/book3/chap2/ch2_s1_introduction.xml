  <para>The primary purpose of this chapter is to present guidelines on performing flood frequency analyses<footnote>

        changes include introduction of non-homogeneous probability models, replacement of product
        log-moments with more efficient estimation methods, use of Bayesian methods to make better
        use of available flood information (such as censored flow data, rating curve error and
        regional information), reduced prescription about the choice of flood probability model,
        improved identification of potentially influential low flows and guidance on fitting
        frequency curves to “difficult” data sets.</para>
