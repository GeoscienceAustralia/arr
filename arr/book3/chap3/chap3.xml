    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>Estimation of peak flows on small to medium sized rural catchments
    is required for the design of culverts, small to medium sized bridges,
    causeways, soil conservation works and for various planning and regulatory
    purposes. Typically, many small to medium sized catchments are ungauged or
    have little recorded streamflow data. In these cases, peak flow estimates
    can be obtained using a Regional Flood Frequency Estimation (RFFE)
    approach, which transfers flood frequency characteristics from a group of
    gauged catchments to the location of interest. Even in cases where there
    is recorded streamflow data it is beneficial to pool the information in
    the gauged record with the RFFE information. A RFFE technique is expected
    to be simple, requiring only readily accessible catchment data to obtain
    design flood estimates relatively quickly.</para>

    <para>In developing the RFFE technique, a number of criteria had to be
    satisfied. These criteria included:</para>

        <para>National consistency in approach;</para>

        <para>Utilise as much of Australia's streamflow database as
        possible.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>The basis for the development of the RFFE technique recommended
    herein, therefore, is a national database consisting of 853 gauged
    catchments. These data were used to develop and test the RFFE technique
    presented in this chapter. Further details of the development of the
    database and RFFE technique are provided by the references noted in
    Appendix A.</para>

    <para>The following sections of this chapter contain a description of the
    conceptual and statistical framework of the adopted RFFE technique, a
    computer-based application tool, referred to as ‘RFFE Model 2015’, that
    implements the adopted RFFE technique and a number of worked examples to
    demonstrate the application of the model.</para>

    <para>Following the guidance provided in Book 1 and Chapter 1 of this
    book, users of the RFFE technique are reminded that there are alternatives
    to the RFFE technique. Furthermore, in accordance with this guidance,
    designers and analysts have a duty to use an alternative technique where
    that alternative is more appropriate for their design flood
    problem.</para>

      <title>Definition of Regional Flood Frequency Estimation</title>

      <para>Regional Flood Frequency Estimation (RFFE) is a data-driven
      approach, which attempts to transfer flood characteristics from a group
      of gauged catchments to ungauged locations of interest (where design
      floods need to be estimated). A range of different methods are available
      to extract regional flood information from the pooled data and to
      transfer the relevant information to an individual ungauged catchment in
      the region (Sivapalan et al. 2013). All of these RFFE techniques use the
      results of at-site Flood Frequency Analysis (FFA, refer to Book 3
      Chapter 2) as basic data. A RFFE technique essentially consists of two
      steps: (i) <emphasis>Formation of Regions</emphasis> - which involves
      identification of the regions for which flood data from the available
      streamflow gauging stations can be pooled for analysis; and
      (ii)<emphasis> Development of Regional Estimation Equations</emphasis> -
      which involves derivation of prediction equations to be used for design
      flood estimation within a region.</para>
    </section>

      <title>Formation of Regions</title>

      <para>In RFFE techniques, the formation of regions can be based on
      geographic proximity or on similarity in catchment attributes. A region
      can be fixed, having a definite common boundary for all sites within it,
      or it can be formed around the ungauged catchment of interest (i.e. the
      location where the flood quantile estimation is desired), taking the
      nearest stations in geographic or catchment attributes space. Regions
      must satisfy explicitly or implicitly the assumption of ‘regional
      homogeneity’. The decision on what constitutes a homogeneous region for
      the purposes of Regional Flood Frequency Estimation depends on the
      methods used, more specifically on the extent to which differences in
      flood characteristics can be expressed through parameters in the
      regionalisation method. There have been many techniques developed which
      attempt to establish homogenous regions. For example, the recommended
      RFFE model for eastern New South Wales (NSW) and Victoria in Australian
      Rainfall and Runoff 1987 (ARR1987), namely the Probabilistic Rational
      Method, used geographical contiguity as an indication of homogeneity; in
      other words the catchments which are closer to each other should have
      similar runoff coefficients (ARR1987).</para>

      <para>There has been little success in the identification of ‘acceptably
      homogeneous regions’ in Australia using statistical measures such as
      those proposed by Hosking and Wallis (1993). A common approach to
      defining a fixed region has been to base the region on political
      boundaries. However, these fixed regions based on state borders and
      other geographical boundaries have often been found to be highly
      heterogeneous (Bates et al., 1998; Rahman, 1997; Haddad, 2008).</para>

      <para>As an alternative to fixed regions, Burn (1990a, 1990b) and Zrinji
      and Burn (1994) proposed the Region Of Influence (ROI) approach where a
      location of interest (i.e. the catchment where flood quantiles are to be
      estimated) is allowed to form its own region by selecting a group of
      ‘nearby catchments’ in either a geographical or catchment attributes
      space (catchment attributes or the catchment characteristics that are
      influential in developing flood flows). The ROI approach attempts to
      reduce the degree of heterogeneity in a proposed region by excluding
      sites located remotely in geographical or catchment attributes space.
      The ROI approach often uses a statistical criterion to select the
      optimum size of the region, such as ‘minimum model error variance’ in
      the regression.</para>

      <title>Development of Regional Flood Frequency Estimation
      Technique</title>

      <para>According to Bates (1994), the most commonly adopted methods to
      develop Regional Flood Frequency Estimation techniques include various
      forms of the Rational Method, the Index Flood Method and regression
      based techniques. In ARR1987, the Probabilistic Rational Method was
      recommended for general use in Victoria and eastern NSW (ARR1987). The
      foundations of the Probabilistic Rational Method are presented by
      Pilgrim and McDermott (1982), Mittelstadt, et al. (1987), and Adams
      (1984). The central component of the Probabilistic Rational Method, is
      the runoff coefficient and, in particular, the 10 year Average
      Recurrence Interval (ARI) runoff coefficient. It is worth noting that
      this runoff coefficient does not have a physical basis but rather is a
      parameter to ensure that the rainfall frequency is transferred to the
      flow frequency. Furthermore, this parameter has been assumed to vary
      smoothly over geographical space for purposes of extrapolating from
      known locations to random locations for application. However, it has
      been found that the runoff coefficient may show sharp variation within a
      close proximity, reflecting discontinuities at many locations,
      particularly at catchment boundaries. Additionally, French (2002) noted
      that the isopleths of the runoff coefficient in ARR1987 ignored the
      existence of watercourses.</para>

      <para>Alternative methods to the Probabilistic Rational Method, such as
      the Index Flood Method heavily rely on the assumption of ‘regional
      homogeneity’, which as previously mentioned is satisfied poorly for
      Australian regional flood data. Studies on regression based RFFE
      techniques for Australia (e.g. Hackelbusch et al., 2009; Haddad, et al.,
      2008; Haddad et al., 2009; Haddad, et al., 2011; Haddad, et al., 2012;
      Haddad and Rahman, 2012; Micevski et al., 2014; Palmen and Weeks, 2009,
      2011; Pirozzi et al., 2009; Rahman, 2005; Rahman, Rima and Weeks, 2008;
      Rahman et al., 2009, 2011a, 2011b, 2012, 2014a, 2014b, 2014c) have
      demonstrated that these techniques are capable of providing quite
      accurate design flood estimates using only a few predictor variables. In
      particular, it has been found that the Generalised Least Squares (GLS)
      based regression technique offers a powerful statistical method which
      accounts for the inter-station correlation of <glossterm
      linkend="glossary_00000">annual maximum flood series</glossterm> and
      across-site variation in flood series record lengths in the estimation
      of the flood quantiles. Use of a GLS-based regression method also allows
      differentiation between sampling error and model error and thus provides
      a more realistic framework for error analysis. The GLS based quantile
      regression technique has been adopted in the US (see, for example,
      Stedinger and Tasker, 1985; Tasker and Stedinger, 1989; Griffis and
      Stedinger, 2007) for development of an RFFE technique.</para>

      <para>As an alternative to the quantile regression technique, the
      parameters of a particular probability distribution can be regressed
      against the catchment characteristics to develop prediction equations
      for the parameters of interest. This method is referred to as Parameter
      Regression Technique (PRT). It is this approach that is the basis of the
      recommended technique for design flood estimation in Australia using the
      RFFE model. For development of a PRT, the Bayesian GLS regression method
      is used to develop prediction equations for the model parameters for the
      three-parameter Log Pearson III (LPIII) distribution; these model
      parameters are the mean, standard deviation and skewness of the annual
      maximum flood series (natural logs). The PRT offers three significant
      advantages over the quantile regression technique:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>It ensures flood quantiles increase smoothly with decreasing
          Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP), an outcome that may not always
          be achieved with quantile regression;</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>It is straightforward to combine any at-site flood information
          with regional estimates (see Book 3 Chapter 2) using the approach
          described by Micevski and Kuczera (2009) to produce more accurate
          quantile estimates; and</para>

      <title>Data Required to Develop Regional Flood Frequency Estimation
      Technique</title>

      <para>The success of a RFFE technique largely depends on the quantity
      and quality of the available data and the capability of the adopted
      statistical techniques to transfer information from gauged to ungauged
      sites within the region. There are two basic types of data required for
      the development and application of RFFE techniques:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Flood data at gauged sites; and</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Catchment characteristics relevant to production of floods in
          both gauged and ungauged catchments.</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>The quality and representativeness of the flood data determine to
      a large degree the accuracy and reliability of regional flood estimates.
      The challenge in collating a database for RFFE lies in maximising the
      amount of useful flood information, while minimising the random and
      systematic error (or ‘noise’) that may be present in some flood
      data.</para>

      <para>In RFFE, various sources of errors in data and their effects on
      final flood estimates need to be recognised. The accuracy of flood
      quantile estimates at each individual gauged site depends largely on
      rating curve accuracy and record length at the individual site. Thus,
      the selection of a minimum record length at an individual site in the
      region is a very important step in any RFFE technique; the record length
      should be as long as possible while retaining enough sites in the region
      to make the results of RFFE useful. Also, the flood data at each site
      should satisfy a number of basic assumptions e.g. homogeneity,
      independence and stationarity. In the case where these assumptions are
      violated, appropriate measures should be taken; suitable techniques
      include GLS regression to account for the inter-station correlation
      (e.g. Stedinger and Tasker, 1985; Griffis and Stedinger, 2007), and
      non-stationary Flood Frequency Analysis to account for climate change
      impact. The data preparation issues for a RFFE technique are discussed
      in more detail by Haddad et al. (2010) and Rahman et al. (2014a,
      2014d).</para>

      <para>The transfer of flood information from gauged to ungauged
      catchments relies on the ability to identify a number of key catchment
      and climate characteristics which determine similarities and differences
      in the flood production of catchments. In the Probabilistic Rational
      Method similarity is assumed to exist on the basis of geographical
      proximity, but in other methods an appropriately small but informative
      set of predictor variables needs to be identified. The accuracy of a
      RFFE technique does not necessarily increase with the number of adopted
      predictor variables. For example, Rahman et al. (1999) used 12 predictor
      variables in an L moments based Index Flood Method for south-east
      Australia. A subsequent study by Rahman (2005) showed that use of only 2
      to 3 predictor variables can provide a similar level of accuracy.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="b3_ch3_s_voncz">
      <title>Accuracy Considerations</title>

      <para>All RFFE techniques are subjected to uncertainty, which,
      generally, is likely to be greater than for at-site Flood Frequency
      Analysis when a good quality and long record of streamflow data set is
      available at the location of interest. A RFFE technique essentially
      represents a ‘transfer function’ that converts predictor variables to a
      flood quantile estimate. It is assumed that use of a limited number of
      predictor variables (e.g. catchment area and design rainfall intensity)
      combined with an optimised transfer function captures the general nature
      of the rainfall-runoff relationship for flood events and hence provides
      flood quantile estimates of ‘acceptable’ accuracy.</para>

      <para>Because a RFFE technique typically has limited predictive power,
      design flood estimates produced by it are likely to have a lower degree
      of accuracy than those from a well calibrated catchment modelling
      system. From the investigations made by Rahman et al. (2009, 2012,
      2014b), it may be stated that the relative accuracy of regional flood
      estimates using the RFFE model presented in this chapter is likely to be
      within ±50% of the true value; however, in a limited number of cases the
      estimation error may exceed ±100% (see <xref
      linkend="b3_ch3_s_yj49v"/>). It is unlikely that any RFFE technique
      would be able to provide flood quantile estimates which are of much
      greater accuracy than this, given the current availability of streamflow
      data (in terms of temporal and spatial coverage) in Australia.</para>

      <para>For catchments having limited recorded streamflow data, the
      combination of at-site data with a RFFE technique is likely to provide
      more accurate flood quantile estimates than either the at-site or
      regional method alone. Details of how limited streamflow data can be
      combined with a RFFE technique is presented in Book 3 Chapter 2. Testing
      has shown this improves estimates in many cases.</para>

      <para>An important assumption in all RFFE techniques is that the small
      set of predictor variables used in the regression equations is able to
      explain the differences in flood producing characteristics of the
      catchments in a region. Not all ungauged catchments located in the
      region satisfy this basic homogeneity assumption; some catchments may
      have characteristics that are substantially different from the gauged
      catchments in the region. <xref linkend="b3_ch3_s_8airu"/> contains
      further discussion on the limits of applicability of the RFFE technique,
      on what constitutes an atypical catchment and recommendations on how to
      derive flood estimates for such catchments.</para>

      <title>Region Of Influence (ROI) Approach</title>

      <para>In the formation of regions, the Region Of Influence (ROI)
      approach has been adopted for the parts of Australia where there are
      adequate numbers of gauged stations within close proximity to form ROI
      sub-regions. In the absence of a proven technique for the use of
      catchment characteristics as the basis for the ROI, the adopted ROI
      approach uses the geographical distance between stations as the distance
      metric and sets a maximum distance for inclusion of stations in the ROI
      sub-region. More details regarding development of ROI sub-regions is
      provided by (Rahman et al. 2015). Nonetheless, a summary of the process
      is presented. In applying the ROI approach, in the first iteration, a
      ROI sub-region consisting of the ten nearest stations to the site of
      interest is formed, the regional prediction equation is developed and
      its prediction error variance noted. At each of the subsequent
      iterations, the radius of the ROI sub-region is increased by 10 km and
      new stations are added to the previously selected stations. The final
      ROI sub-region for the location of interest is then selected as the one
      exhibiting the lowest prediction error variance.</para>

      <para>One of the apparent limitations of the ROI approach is that for
      each of the gauged sites in the region, the regional prediction equation
      has a different set of model parameters; hence a single regional
      prediction equation cannot be pre-specified. To overcome this problem,
      the parameters of the regional prediction equations for all the gauged
      catchment locations are pre-estimated and integrated with the RFFE Model
      2015 (see <xref linkend="b3_ch3_s_8u3cs"/> for more details). To derive
      flood quantile estimate at an ungauged catchment of interest, the RFFE
      Model 2015 takes the inverse distance weighted average value of flood
      quantile estimates based on up to 15 nearest gauged catchment locations
      within a 300 km radius from the catchment of interest. This ensures a
      smooth variation of flood quantile estimates over the space.</para>

      <para>In some situations, the sampling covariance matrix explains all
      the variability observed in the data, which means the left-hand side of
      <xref linkend="b3_ch3_e_w6z3z"/> will be less than n – (k + 1) even if
      σ<subscript>δ</subscript>² is zero. In these circumstances, the MOM
      estimator of the model error variance is generally taken to be
      zero.</para>

      <para>With the Bayesian approach, it is assumed that there is no prior
      information on any of the β parameters; thus a multivariate normal
      distribution with mean zero and a large variance (e.g. greater than 100)
      is used as a prior for the regression coefficient parameters. This prior
      is considered to be almost non-informative, which produces a probability
      distribution function that is generally flat in the region of interest.
      The prior information for the model error variance
      σ<subscript>δ</subscript>² is represented by a one parameter exponential
      distribution. Further description of the adopted Bayesian GLS regression
      can be found in Haddad, et al. (2011) and Haddad and Rahman
      (2012).</para>

      <title>Development of Confidence Limits for the Estimated Flood
      Quantiles</title>

      <para>In developing the confidence limits for the estimated flood
      quantiles, a Monte Carlo simulation approach is adopted by assuming that
      the uncertainty in the first three parameters of the LPIII distribution
      (i.e. the mean, standard deviation and skewness of the logarithms of the
      annual maximum flood series) can be specified by a multivariate normal
      distribution. Here the correlations among the three parameters for a
      given region are estimated from the residuals of the GLS regression
      models of the LPIII parameters. The mean of the LPIII parameter is given
      by its regional predicted value and the standard deviation of the LPIII
      parameter is the square root of the average variance of prediction of
      the parameter at the nearest gauged location. Based on 10,000 simulated
      values of the LPIII parameters from the multivariate normal distribution
      as defined above, 10,000 Q<subscript>x</subscript> values are estimated,
      which are then used to develop the 90% confidence intervals.</para>

        <para>Data-rich areas include most of the coastal belts of Australia where there are a large
          number of recorded streamflow stations as shown in <xref linkend="b3_ch3_f_55d8a"/>. An
          upper limit of catchment size of 1,000 km² is adopted. However, in some states (such as
          the Northern Territory), a few larger catchments are included as the total number of
          catchments with areas less than 1,000 km² is too small. The cut-off record length of 19
          years was selected to maximise the number of eligible stations on the consideration that a
          higher cut-off would reduce that number.</para>

        <para>The selected streams were unregulated since major regulation
        (e.g. a large dam on the stream) affects the rainfall-runoff
        relationship significantly by increasing additional storage effects.
        Streams with minor regulation, such as small farm dams and diversion
        weirs, were not excluded because this type of regulation is unlikely
        to have a significant effect on large annual floods. Gauging stations
        on streams subject to major upstream regulation were excluded from the
        data set. Catchments with more than 10% of the area affected by
        urbanisation were also excluded from the study data set. Catchments
        known to have undergone major land use changes, such as the clearing
        of forests or changing of agricultural practices over the period of
        streamflow records were excluded from the data set. Stations graded as
        'poor quality' or with specific comments by the gauging authority
        regarding quality of the data were assessed in greater detail; if
        stations were deemed 'low quality' they are excluded.</para>

        <para>The Annual Maximum flood series data may be affected by
        multi-decadal climate variability and climate change, which are not
        easy to deal with. The effects of multi-decadal climate variability
        can be accounted for by increasing the cut-off record length at an
        individual station. However, the impacts of climate change present a
        serious problem in terms of the applicability of the past data in
        predicting future flood frequency; this requires further research
        (Ishak <emphasis>et al</emphasis>., 2013). This is further discussed
        in <xref linkend="b3_ch3_s_31eib"/>.</para>

        <para>The data sets for the initially selected potential catchments
        are further examined, as detailed in Haddad <emphasis>et
        al</emphasis>. (2010) and Rahman <emphasis>et al</emphasis>. 2014 (a,
        b, c): gaps in the Annual Maximum flood series were filled as far as
        could be justified, outliers were detected using the multiple
        Grubbs-Beck test (Lamontagne <emphasis>et al</emphasis>., 2013; Cohn
        <emphasis>et al</emphasis>., 2013), errors associated with
        extrapolation of rating curves were investigated and the presence of
        trends with the data were checked. From an initial number of
        approximately 1200 catchments, a total of 798 catchments were finally
        adopted from all over Australia (excluding catchments in the arid
        regions, where some of the above criteria were relaxed, as discussed
        in Section 5).</para>

        <para>The record lengths of the Annual Maximum flood series of these
        798 stations range from 19 to 102 years (median: 37 years). The
        catchment areas of the selected 798 catchments range from 0.5 km² to
        4,325 km² (median: 178 km²). The geographical distribution of the
        selected 798 catchments is shown in <xref linkend="b3_ch3_f_55d8a"/>

      <title>Data Used to Develop RFFE Technique</title>

      <para>Most of Australia's interior falls into the arid and semi-arid areas (referred to as
        arid areas), which are characterised by low mean annual rainfall in relation to mean annual
        potential evaporation. Rainfall events tend to be infrequent and their occurrence and
        severity are highly variable. Typically dry antecedent conditions may result in many
        rainfall events not producing any significant runoff. However, severe rainfall events can
        still result in significant flooding with serious consequences. Large transmission losses
        (i.e. losses occurring from flow in rivers and other drainage channels) in may also result
        in discharge reducing in a downstream direction, particularly in the lower river reaches of
        larger catchments in arid areas. The special flooding characteristics of catchments in arid
        areas make it desirable to treat them separately from catchments in more humid areas. In
        arid areas, annual maximum flood series generally contain many zero values; these values
        were censored in Flood Frequency Analysis.</para>

      <para>In ARR1987 (Pilgrim, 1987), only a few catchments were used from
      arid areas to develop RFFE methods. Since the publication of ARR1987,
      there has been little improvement in terms of streamflow data
      availability in most of the arid areas of Australia. In the preparation
      of the Regional Flood Frequency Estimation database, only a handful of
      catchments from the arid areas satisfy the selection criteria. To
      increase the number of stations from the arid areas to develop a RFFE
      method, the selection criteria were relaxed i.e. the threshold
      streamflow record length was reduced to 10 years and the limit of
      catchment size was increased from 1,000 km² to 6,000 km². These criteria
      result in the selection of 55 catchments from the arid areas of
      Australia (<xref linkend="b3_ch3_f_r2u60"/> and <xref
      linkend="b3_ch3_t_0x8hz"/>). The selected catchments have average annual
      rainfall less than 500 mm. The catchment areas range from 0.1 to 5,975
      km² (median: 259 km²) and streamflow record lengths range from 10 to 46
      years (median: 27 years).</para>

      <para>The formation of regions in the arid areas in Australia is a
      difficult task, as there are only 55 catchments available over a vast
      area of Australia. There are two alternatives: (i) formation of one
      region with all the 55 stations; and (ii) formation of smaller
      sub-regions based on geographical proximity, noting that too small a
      region makes the developed RFFE technique of little statistical

      the formation of two regions from the 55 arid catchments: Region 6 (11

        at-site Flood Frequency Analyses for the arid catchments are conducted using the FLIKE

    <title>Relative Accuracy of the RFFE Technique</title>
    <para>The reliability and accuracy of the quantile estimates by the RFFE technique is assessed
      using leave-one-out (LOO) validation. In the LOO validation, one catchment is left out from
      the model data set and the RFFE technique is applied to the catchment that was left out. The
      flood quantiles estimated using the RFFE technique are then compared with the at-site flood
      frequency estimates obtained by FLIKE (Kuczera, 1999) as mentioned in <xref
        linkend="b3_ch3_s_4foca"/>. The procedure is repeated for each catchment in the regional
      data set to provide an overall assessment of the performance of the RFFE technique.</para>
    <para>The reliability of the RFFE flood quantile confidence limits described in <xref
        linkend="b3_ch3_s_7r0rn"/> is assessed empirically using standardised quantile residuals.
      The quantile residual is the difference between the logarithm of flood quantile estimates
      obtained using at-site Flood Frequency Analysis and the RFFE technique. The standardised
      quantile residual is the quantile residual divided by its standard deviation which is the
      square root of the sum of the RFFE predictive variance of the flood quantile and at-site
      quantile variance (Haddad and Rahman, 2012; Micevski <emphasis>et al</emphasis>., 2014). This
      accounts for both the model error (e.g. inadequacy of the RFFE model) and the sampling error
      (e.g. due to limited streamflow record length). If the uncertainty in the log quantile
      estimates has been adequately described, the standardized quantile residuals should be
      consistent with a standard normal distribution.</para>
    <para><xref linkend="b3_ch3_f_6ppin"/> shows the plots of standardised residuals vs. normal
      scores for Region 1 for AEPs of 10% and 5% (the plots for other AEPs for Region 1 are provided
      in Appendix B). Plots for other regions can be seen also in Rahman <emphasis>et al</emphasis>.
      (2014b). These plots include 558 catchments from Region 1 used in the RFFE model and some 28
      catchments which were excluded from the RFFE model based on the results of preliminary
      analysis and unusual characteristics such as significant natural floodplain storage. <xref
        linkend="b3_ch3_f_6ppin"/> reveals that most of the 558 catchments closely follow a 1:1
      straight line indicating that the assumption of normality of the residuals is not inconsistent
      with the evidence; this is supported by the application of the Anderson-Darling and
      Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests which show that the assumption of the normality of the residuals
      cannot be rejected at the 10% level of significance. Under the assumptions of normality,
      approximately 90% of the standardised quantile residuals should lie between ± 2, which is
      largely satisfied. There are a few catchments with standardised residual values close to ± 3.
      These correspond to instances where the RFFE confidence limits may not be reliable; an example
      of such catchment is provided in <xref linkend="b3_ch3_s_p4hvx"/>. Same conclusion applies to
      the other Humid Coastal regions.</para>

    <para>The main conclusion from this analysis is that the quantification of uncertainty in the

      some catchments may not be adequately represented by the catchments used in the RFFE analysis.
      Users of the RFFE Model 2015 should check that the catchment of interest is not atypical
      compared with the gauged catchments included in the ROI used to develop the RFFE estimate. To
      assist users in this regard the RFFE Model 2015 discussed in <xref linkend="b3_ch3_s_8u3cs"/>
      and <xref linkend="b3_ch3_s_8airu"/> lists the RFFE Model gauged catchments located nearest to
      the ungauged catchment of interest. The accuracy of the flood quantile estimates provided by
      the RFFE technique is evaluated by using the Relative Error (RE) defined as:</para>

    <para>It should be noted here that LOO is a more rigorous validation technique compared with the

      of the total catchments). Hence, the relative error that is generated by LOO is expected to be
      higher than if split-sample validation were used. The medians of the absolute relative error
      values from the LOO validation for different regions are reported in <xref
        linkend="b3_ch3_t_zm9sj"/>. It can be seen that for the Humid Coastal regions, Region 5 (SW
      Western Australia) has the highest relative error (59 to 69%) and Region 3 (South Australia)
      has the smallest relative error (33 to 41%).</para>

    <title>Bias Correction</title>
    <para>In the spatial plots of the standardised residuals, few pockets of notable
      under-estimation and over-estimation are detected. To overcome this problem, a bias correction
      is implemented, which attempts to provide estimates of <emphasis role="italic">M</emphasis>
      (for Humid Coastal areas) (Equation 1) and Q<subscript>10</subscript> (for arid areas)
      (Equation 12) closer to the observed <emphasis role="italic">M</emphasis> or
        Q<subscript>10</subscript> at the location of each of the 853 model gauged catchments. This
      is based on a bias correction factor (Q<subscript>obs_FFA/QRFFE_predicted</subscript>),
      obtained at each of the 853 model gauged catchments. A regional smooth bias correction factor
      is then derived applying a Natural Neighbor approach, which is embedded in the RFFE Model. In
      practice, for an ungauged location of interest, an interpolated bias correction factor is
      calculated by the software based on nearby 15 gauged catchments. It is found that this
      approach reduces the pockets of bias in the spatial plots of the standardised residuals and
      hence adopted in the RFFE Model 2015. </para>

    <title>Combining Regional and At-Site Quantile Estimates</title>

    <para>Unless a station has a very long Annual Maximum flood series data
    (e.g. greater than 100 years), it is desirable to combine at-site and
    regional flood frequency quantile estimates to achieve a more accurate
    estimate. The RFFE Model 2015 (see <xref linkend="b3_ch3_s_8u3cs"/> for
    the description of the model) provides the necessary parameter set and
    data in its output to combine the regional flood quantile estimates with
    the at-site data. This is discussed in more detail in Book 3 Chapter
    2.</para>

  <section xml:id="b3_ch3_s_31eib">
    <title>Impact of Climate Change</title>
    <para>The adopted regional estimation equations include design rainfall intensity as a key input
      variable. As a result the impact of climate change as reflected in changes in design rainfall
      estimates (which are expected to be upgraded regularly) can be propagated through the RFFE
      Model 2015 to provide a first order estimate of the impact of climate change on regional
      design flood estimates. This approach assumes that that the contribution of the other
      catchment characteristics affecting flood production does not change with future climate
      states. Given that this assumption is unlikely to be valid (Ball, 2014), the use of potential
      future rainfall intensities in the RFFE Model 2015 illustrates the sensitivity of the current
      design flood estimates to the rainfall intensities.</para>

      when additional catchments are available that satisfy the criteria of catchment selection
        (<xref linkend="b3_ch3_s_wfiku"/>). Furthermore, additional predictor variables can
      potentially be included in the RFFE Model to enhance model accuracy, in particular if GIS

      density and main stream slope.</para>

          that the gauges are not fully representative of the wide range of
          conditions encountered in the arid areas. Gauges are generally
          installed in defined channels which may not be apparent in many arid
          areas. The flood estimates for the arid areas given by the RFFE
          Model 2015 should be used with caution. Users need to compare local
          catchment conditions with those at gauged locations and in many
          cases may need to adjust RFFE Model 2015 estimates to account for
          the local catchment conditions (see <xref

      <title>Catchments with Atypical Characteristics</title>

      <para>The development of the RFFE technique is based on the assumption
      that the catchment characteristics represented in the regression
      equation (e.g. catchment area, design rainfall intensity and shape
      factor) account for the important differences in flood characteristics
      between sites in a region. It should be recognised that flood estimates
      generated by the RFFE Model 2015 for a catchment with flood
      characteristics that are distinctly different from the typical gauged
      catchments in the region may not only be associated with larger error
      margins but also with significant bias. In such situations engineering
      judgment must be used to assess if any adjustment of the Regional Flood
      Frequency Estimate is required (based on comparison of other relevant
      catchment characteristics). To support such an assessment, the RFFE
      Model 2015 output describes the set of gauged catchments used in
      developing the RFFE Model, i.e. which are located closest to the
      ungauged catchment of interest.</para>

      <para>The following additional catchment attributes may need to be

          storage areas in catchments with extensive floodplains or swamps

          RFFE Model 2015 would thus tend to <emphasis>overestimate</emphasis>
          peak flows and they could be regarded as <emphasis>upper bound flood
          estimates</emphasis> for these catchments. (See example in <xref

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Drainage efficiency</emphasis> - steep catchments,
          streams with little vegetation along banks, catchments affected by
          large scale drainage or flood protection works can be expected to
          produce faster flood flows velocities, less attenuation and thus
          higher peak flows; flood estimates from the RFFE Model 2015 would
          thus tend to <emphasis>underestimate</emphasis> peak flows and they

    the RFFE Model estimates need to be adjusted to account for the storage
    effect of the catchment by applying an appropriate technique (see <xref

      1% AEPs where the RFFE Model estimates are higher compared with the
      at-site FFA estimates. <xref linkend="b3_ch3_f_mb7b8"/> also shows that
      the confidence limits of the RFFE Model 2015 is much wider compared with
      at-site FFA confidence band, which is expected.</para>

      <para>The basic input data for the Morass Creek at Uplands, VIC are

      the RFFE Model and at-site FFA flood estimates, which shows that RFFE
      Model estimates are much higher compared with at-site FFA estimates.
      This catchment has significant natural floodplain storage which is not
      typical for other catchments in the Region of Influence (ROI) on which
      the RFFE Model 2015 estimates are based. The RFFE Model 2015 estimates
      are thus not directly applicable. Here, the RFFE Model estimates would
      need to be adjusted downwards to account for the floodplain storage
      effect by applying an appropriate technique.</para>
