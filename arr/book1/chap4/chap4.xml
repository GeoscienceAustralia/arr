          <para><emphasis>Storage</emphasis> - The storage of the data is
          performed in this component of the data cycle. In general, the
          storage of data will comprise the insertion of the data into a
          digital database. It is important to note that the manner of data
          storage should ensure that its retrieval is both practical and
          feasible. If retrieval is not easy, there is no addition to the data
          available for design flood estimation.</para>

          <para>There are many different forms of data stored in a database
          which in turn influences the data storage design. Commonly, spatial
          databases are referred to as Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
          while databases used to store temporal data can be referred to as a
          Time-Series Managers (TSM). These computerised storage facilities
          have superseded, in general, the previous techniques based on data
          storage through maps and charts. There are a large number of
          alternative GISs and TSMs that can be used for data storage. It is
          not the purpose of Australian Rainfall and Runoff to recommend a
          particular GIS or TSM but rather to note their use for storing data
          relevant to design flood estimation.</para>

          <para>Since 2008, the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) has been responsible for delivering
            water data throughout Australia. As part of this role, the BoM has been collecting water
            data from more than 200 organisations across the nation and is using this data to report
            on water availability, condition and use in a nationally consistent way. To facilitate
            this role, the BoM is building the Australian Water Resources Information System (AWRIS)
            as a secure repository for water data and as a means to deliver high quality water data
            to all Australians.</para>

          <para>The aim of AWRIS is to allow the

            will be able to merge historical water data records with current observations to suit a
            variety of user needs. By spatially enabling this data we will be able to query and
            report the data in many different ways. Data stored in AWRIS will be delivered to the
            web, to mobile devices and various hydrologic forecasting systems to be operated by the
            BoM.</para>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Analysis</emphasis> - It is common that analysis of
          data will be required. The analysis techniques form this component
          of the data cycle. The steps involved in this component can be
          summarised as data retrieval, and data usage. It is worth noting
          that the data obtained from the analysis could be considered as part
          of the data generation component. Hence there is some similarity
          between the generation and analysis components.</para>

          <para>There are many alternative analysis techniques. For design
          flood estimation purposes, the most commonly used analysis
          techniques would be statistical modelling (for example, flood
          frequency analysis) and catchment response modelling using a
          catchment modelling system. Both of these techniques result in the
          generation of additional data that, in turn, requires editing and
          storage.</para>

            analysed data is presented in a manner that is understandable to relevant stakeholders.
            The technical level of the presented data would not be constant for all presentations
            but, rather, would vary with the technical expertise of the audience. The important
            point about the presentation of data is that it is presented in a manner that is clear
            and precise for the audience.</para>

        <title>Peak Level Records</title>

        <para>If the flood event has been of a significant nature, it is likely that government
          agencies have been able to collect some actual flood levels at a variety of locations.
          This is typically done by mobilising agency staff to place markers (paint, stakes, nails,
          surveyor’s tape) either indicating maximum flood extent (e.g. spray paint on a road, stake
          in ground) or peak flood
          level<?oxy_insert_start author="RadhikaChhotai" timestamp="20151007T170603+1100"?>s<?oxy_insert_end?>
          (e.g. nail in a tree). Ideally, each marker should have the time and
          <?oxy_insert_start author="RadhikaChhotai" timestamp="20151007T170613+1100"?>the
          <?oxy_insert_end?>staff member’s name recorded at the marker
          site<?oxy_delete author="RadhikaChhotai" timestamp="20151007T170621+1100" content=" as well"?>.
          Following the event, surveyors can measure x,y location data and z flood level data at
          each of these markers. It is also useful to photograph the site and to record ground
          level. Surveyors should also include the time at which the markers were placed, by whom
          and type (e.g. nail in tree) in their

          Residents often also record peak flood levels, particularly if the flood has inundated any
          buildings on their property. Post event flood levels can be collected by residents by a
          questionnaire and reliable marks surveyed. An assessment as to the reliability of these
          levels can only be made after viewing the marks themselves and noting the care with which
          the recording has been made. Have different event dates been recorded by the resident or
          is the resident relying on memory to determine one event from another? Has the location of
          the marks changed in any way since the record was made? For example, if the marks are made
          near the front door, has the house been raised at any time since? Detailed discussion with
          the resident can often unearth important details otherwise unknown.</para>

        <title>Debris Marks</title>

        <para>Debris marks are best measured as soon as possible after the
        event, when the debris or scum line is still fresh. This ensures that
        the mark is attributable to the event of interest. The longer it takes
        the surveyor to measure the mark, the more chance there is for errors
        as debris marks may be from an older event or an event in a tributary
        rather than the main channel of interest. Debris marks can be
        inaccurate for a number of reasons. They can be influenced by dynamic
        hydraulic effects such as waves, eddies, pressure surges, bores or
        transient effects, which may not be accounted for in the model. For
        example, if the debris mark is located within a region of fast flowing
        floodwater it is possible that the floodwater has pushed the debris up
        against an obstacle, lodging it at a higher level than the surrounding
        flood level. More common though is the fact that debris often lodges
        at a level lower than the peak flood level. The reason for this is
        that for debris to be deposited it needs to have somewhere to lodge
        and this elevation is not always at the peak flood level. For example,
        the classic place for debris lodgement is a barbwire fence with
        horizontal strands of wire. If the flood level almost reached the top
        strand of barbwire, debris will not lodge in the top strand but rather
        on the second from top strand, which may be about 0.3m lower than the
        peak flood level. It is recommended that the surveyor be asked to
        record as much information as possible about the mark itself (e.g.
        debris on barbwire fence spacing 0.35m) so the modeller is able to
        consider reasons for discrepancies in the calibration process, if they
        arise.</para>

        similar manner. Photograph and video evidence can also be beneficial
        in this regard and can often assist long-term residents remember

        mindful of the fact that memories can sometimes fade or be skewed by
        other events that have occurred between particularly when several
        floods occur close together. In addition, information providers may
        not be able to provide unbiased information due to a vested interest
        (e.g. pride or financial gain etc) in the level to which an historic
        event reached. Again, detailed discussions with residents and
        stakeholders can provide the modeller with a general feel for the
        reliability of all anecdotal evidence. Inconsistent facts have to be
        identified and discarded and discrepancies have to be studied and

      <para>Daily rainfall is nominally measured each day at 9:00 am local time. At the majority of
        rainfall sites, observations are taken by volunteers who send in a monthly record of daily
        precipitation at the end of each month. A subset of observers at strategic locations, as

        million records from a network of over 16000 locations. Other types of
        weather data that are stored in ADAM include air temperature,
        humidity, wind velocity, sunshine, cloud cover, soil temperatures,
        upper atmospheric wind and temperature, and observed weather phenomena

          <title>Cross-Sections</title>

          <para>A survey of cross-sections is required only when the design flood estimation
            requires
            <?oxy_delete author="RadhikaChhotai" timestamp="20151007T182510+1100" content="the "?>application
            of a catchment modelling system to generate data that is not available from a catchment
            monitoring program. Hence, the scope of a cross-section survey depends on the type of
            the catchment modelling being used. Where
            <?oxy_delete author="RadhikaChhotai" timestamp="20151007T182558+1100" content="the "?>catchment
            modelling is focussed on hydrologic simulation (using, for example, a conceptual
            rainfall-runoff model), the
            cross<?oxy_delete author="RadhikaChhotai" timestamp="20151007T182605+1100" content=" "?>-section
            data required is minimal. However, where the catchment modelling requires hydraulic
            simulation (using, for example, a one-dimensional network model), the cross-section data
            required will be more extensive.</para>

          <para>The important characteristics of the cross-section data
          include the lateral extent and longitudinal spacing of
          cross-sections. The lateral extent of the cross-section must be
          sufficient to include key in-bank elements. Erring on the
          conservative side is wise with the cross-section extending up to at
          least the top-of-bank. When surveying in-bank cross-sections, good
          field notes and/or photos describing the nature of the channel are
          vital for proper interpretation post collection. There are numerous
          references such as Stewardson and Howes (2002) that describe flood
          study cross-section survey requirements in detail. The overriding
          principle being that the cross-section data is adequate to estimate
          the shape and slope of the channel so that suitable estimates of the
          flow conveyance capacity of the channel can be calculated.</para>

          <para>The influence of in-bank features on flood discharge behaviour
          tends to reduce as the magnitude of the flood discharges increases.
          For example, bank-full capacity of a river channel may represent
          100% of a 0.2 or 0.5 EY discharge but less than 10% of a 1% AEP
          discharge.</para>

          <para>When the catchment modelling for design flood estimation
          requires consideration of floodplain discharges, then cross-sections
          of the entire floodplain inclusive of the channel are required. This
          requirement is particularly relevant to catchment modelling systems
          using one-dimensional hydraulic modelling techniques. More details
          of this modelling approach are presented in <xref
          linkend="book7"/>.</para>

          <para>In these circumstances, the cross-sections can be spaced more
          widely than when only in-bank flood discharges need to be
          considered. Ideally, cross-sections are provided at break-out points
          to the floodplain and at all locations where there is a significant
          change in channel characteristics, such as conveyance. Additionally,
          it is worthwhile to include survey breaklines along the tops of the
          banks to provide an additional aid for the hydraulic modelling of
          overbank breakouts during design (or historical) flood
          events.</para>

          <para>It is also worth noting that field practicalities such as bank
          vegetation, access to the channel and water depth may influence the
          actual location of the cross-sections surveyed.</para>

        <section xml:id="b1_ch4_s_f5p72">
          <title>Structures and Drainage Infrastructure</title>

          <para>Structures in the waterway and on the floodplain may have a
          significant influence on flood behaviour. Structures requiring
          survey include:</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>Levees;</para>

              <para>Drainage infrastructure such as pipes and pits.</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>

          <para>Often these structures constrict and obstruct flood discharges
          thereby influencing the design flood estimation. The effects on
          flood behaviour may be intentional (such as a weir) or unintentional
          (such as blockage at a culvert). Where the effect on flood discharge
          is unintentional, it is worth noting that the effect may be
          stochastic and hence the likelihood of the effect needs to be
          considered by a suitable joint probability technique. Irrespective
          of whether the influence is intentional or unintentional, these
          structures will have an influence on the estimation of the design
          flood characteristic.</para>

          <para>Hydraulic structures generally act to control the discharge
          behaviour in accordance with a particular management strategy. As
          most management strategies are concerned with frequent discharges,
          there are control structures designed to operate under flood
          conditions as part of an operational flood management strategy.
          Hence, the impact of these structures will vary with the management
          strategy and flood magnitude.</para>

          <para>The purpose of a levee is to divert discharges as part of an
          operational flood management strategy. As part of this strategy,
          levees are designed only to protect floodplains for a specified
          portion of the relationship between the likelihood and magnitude of
          a flood event; in other words, there is a defined probability that a
          levee can be overtopped (with or without failure of the levee bank)
          by a flood rarer than the levee was designed to protect against.
          Hence, in design flood estimation, the geometric properties of a
          levee are important to enable suitable estimation of the flood
          magnitudes (and hence probabilities) of design events likely to
          result in hydrologic (and/or structural) failure of the
          levee.</para>

          <para>Hence, geometric details of structures are required. These
          details include:</para>

          topographic data across a broad area. Commonly, this topographic data is represented as a
          Digital Elevation Model (DEM). It should be noted that there is no universal definition of
          the terms Digital Elevation Model (DEM), Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and Digital Surface
          Model (DSM) in

          Both DTM and DSM may be referred to as DEM.</para>

        <para>Usually, a DEM is represented as a raster (a grid of squares) or
          <?oxy_delete author="RadhikaChhotai" timestamp="20151007T222045+1100" content="as "?>a
          vector-based Triangular Irregular Network (TIN). According to Toppe (1987), the TIN DEM
          dataset is referred to as a primary (measured) DEM, whereas the Raster DEM is referred to
          as a secondary (computed) DEM; this definition, however, predates the widespread
          availability of Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) (also known as Light Detection and Ranging -
          LiDAR) data for definition of the catchment surface topography.</para>

          data does not cover the desired area.</para>

        <para>At present, the two principal techniques used in aerial survey

          measurements from photographs; in the context being used herein, it is the science of
          making measurements about the topographic surface of catchments. Generally, topographic
          data obtained through photogrammetry consists of spot elevations plus linear

          such as a ridge, road, or stream. No triangle in a TIN may cross a breakline (in other
          words, breaklines are enforced as triangle edges). Elevation levels along a breakline can
          be constant or variable.</para>

        <para>ALS or LiDAR is a remote sensing technology that measures
        distance by illuminating a target (in this case, the ground surface)
        with a laser and analysing the reflected light. Raw ALS data consists
        of a dense cloud of spot elevations classified into ground and
        non-ground strikes. This raw ALS data usually has the non-ground
        strikes removed prior to provision. Analysis of the raw ALS data
        usually will result in a raster DEM.</para>

        <para>It should be noted that neither photogrammetry
          <?oxy_insert_start author="RadhikaChhotai" timestamp="20151007T222709+1100"?>n<?oxy_insert_end?>or
          ALS can penetrate water surfaces. Only the water surface level at the time of capture

          <?oxy_insert_end?>be measured. If the bathymetry under the water surface is relevant in
          the context of the numerical modelling, bathymetric data must be collected and
          incorporated separately. Similarly, neither

          <title>Photogrammetry</title>

          <para>Photogrammetry is a measurement technique where the three dimensional (x,y,z)
            coordinates of an object are determined by measurements made from a stereo image
            consisting of two (or more) photographs; usually, these photographs are taken from
            different passes of an aerial photography flight. In this technique, the common points
            are identified on each image. A line of sight (or ray) can be built from the camera
            location to the point on the object. It is the intersection of its rays (triangulation)

            scene known as priori.</para>

          <para>The accuracy of the photogrammetric data is a function of

            Typically, the accuracy requested when scoping photogrammetric data collection for flood
            study purposes ranges from +/- 0.1 m to +/- 0.3 m. Note that the accuracy of the
            developed design flood profile cannot have an accuracy better than the catchment data
            used to estimate the design flood profile.</para>

          <para>As the technique is based upon the comparison of photographic
          images, shading and obscuring of the ground surface by vegetation
          can reduce coverage in specific areas. However, as photogrammetric
          analysis can utilise manual inspection of the stereo pair of
          photographs, the photogrammetrist is sometimes able to pick the odd
          ground surface visible through tree or crop cover. In this way,
          photogrammetry is sometimes able to provide some reliable points in
          vegetated areas.</para>

            pulses of light are fired toward the earth by the laser instrument. These light pulses

          <para>The vertical and horizontal accuracy of ground surface level
          measurement by ALS is a function of the laser specification, flying
          height, ground control and the surface coverage. Hard road surfaces,
          for example, normally are able to be measured accurately, but other
          surface types (for example, swamps or heavily vegetated areas) are
          not easy to measure and hence the measurements must be treated with
          caution. It is useful to note that many quoted accuracy values for
          ALS data are in reference to the data accuracy for clear hard
          ground. For clear, hard ground (that is ground with no surface
          coverage), the nominal accuracy for technology commonly applied in

            </table>A disadvantage of the ALS data capture method (compared
          to, for example, low-level photogrammetry) is the absence of
          breaklines in the data to define distinct, continuous topographic
          features and significant changes in grade. While the horizontal
          density of points usually is quite high ( average point spacing of 1
          to 2 metres depending on flying height and sampling frequency),
          features such as narrow banks/levees or channels will only be
          resolved if the data are sampled on a very small grid (less than 1
          to 2m grid). This can result in large and unwieldy terrain

              the raw ALS point cloud dataset. While the dimensions of the

              smaller the dataset but the surface topography will have an
              apparent lower definition. It is also worth noting that
              definition of the surface topography only needs to be adequate
              to provide the necessary information and that any additional
              definition will not provide either additional flood data or

              heavy vegetation or surface water. These areas can be removed
              during the processing as "non-ground" points. When using a
              processed ALS dataset, there will be situations where a
              non-ground elevation point (for example, a point that has hit
              the canopy of trees) has not been removed during processing. As

              treated as a surface elevation. In some situations. Errors of
              this type are obvious and can be removed manually. In other
              situations, they may not be obvious and hence will form part of
              the DEM (Digital Elevation Model) used in the analysis. Users
              need to be cognisant of errors of this type in ALS data and the

              the catchment modelling system.</para>

          <title>Aerial Survey Quality Checks</title>

          <para>As discussed in <xref linkend="b1_ch4_s_lyk4o"/>, survey data
          is not exact and will have a tolerance or a stated level of
          accuracy. Data obtained from aerial survey is the same. With data
          obtained from aerial survey, accuracy is dependent upon a number of
          factors, including flying height and the number of control points.
          In general, the required accuracy is advised prior to commencement
          of data collection and the surveyor designs the data collection
          program needed to achieve the desired accuracy.</para>

          <para>An important point to note is that the accuracy of the
          collected data is checked and confirmed. The resultant stated
          accuracy typically does not apply to the DTM derived from the survey
          data but rather to the individual elevation points sampled during
          the data generation program. This is an important distinction and
          users of a DTM derived from aerial survey data needs to be aware of
          this feature.</para>

          <para>There are a number of methods that may be used to check the
          accuracy of the aerial survey.</para>

                DTM SURFACE: Independent field surveys of selected quality check points can be
                compared to the DTM. However, this surface has been interpolated from the aerial
                elevation data and, unless the accuracy stated by the aerial surveyor referred to
                the DEM, the correlation in accuracy values is not guaranteed. But, this method can
                provide a preliminary indication of accuracy, particularly if the independent field

                POINT: Independent field surveys of selected quality check points can be compared to

                match the coordinates of the aerial data points to ensure that a valid comparison is
                being made. To do this, the aerial survey must first be received in order to select
                the points at which comparison will be made, which may slow the data collection
                phase. Alternatively, early liaison with the aerial surveyor may allow the location
                of a number of points to be known before data provision, which may save time;

                DTM SURFACE: A more appropriate approach may be to field survey a number of
                breakline strings along key linear features. These strings may be some 50 m - 200 m
                in length with points at regular spacing (say every 5 -15 m). A comparison can then
                be made of the profiles along the feature determined from both the aerial and field
                survey. In addition, if the strings are across conveyance paths (i.e. they are
                cross-sections), the modeller can check that conveyance cross-sectional areas are
                adequately represented. These comparisons enable a qualitative assessment of aerial
                survey accuracy for a given region within the study area. A number of surveyed
                strings may be required across the study area to gain an overall appreciation of
                accuracy.</para>

          then a traditional surface survey technique may be suitable. For deeper, larger water

        <title>Aerial Photographs</title>

        <para>Aerial photographs are an important source of qualitative data
        and can be collected during an aerial survey. Geo-referenced (or
        ortho-rectified) aerial photos can be supplied as part of a
        photogrammetric survey. These geo-referenced aerial photographs are
        aerial photos where spatial coordinates have been added to locate the
        photograph. It is important to recognise that the raw aerial
        photograph is spatially distorted, being a planar image of a curved
        surface of variable height. In ortho-rectifying the image, the image
        is scaled, rotated and stretched so that various reference locations
        move to their correct coordinate locations.</para>

        <para>A consequence of this is the location of features on an aerial
        photograph will have a degree of uncertainty. For example, if a
        rectified aerial photograph is used to locate a flood mark, the
        attributed location will be subject to a tolerance. In an area of high
        flood gradient this can result in differences between observed and
        simulated flood levels that do not accurately represent the true
        differences.</para>

        <para>Aerial photographs, while not providing quantitative data
        directly, can provide additional information about flowpaths, flow
        obstacles and floodplain vegetation that is not always immediately
        evident or accessible on a site inspection. Additionally, aerial
        photos can be a useful guide when defining parameters for floodplain
        characteristics (for example, roughness coefficients) and can be used
        to develop a spatial map of the floodplain parameter.</para>

        <para>Another example of the use of aerial photography is its use in
        urban areas to define building outlines or fence lines where these are
        to be included within the hydraulic model and can be a reasonable
        source of information for assessing the total imperviousness of a
        catchment (see <xref linkend="b5_ch4"/>).</para>

        <para>Finally, when historical aerial photography is available, it is
        useful in assessing catchment development or sourcing information on
        the floodplain development when historical events occurred.</para>

        <title>Historical Topography and Infrastructure</title>

        <para>All data collection methods covered thus far have been concerned
        with present day catchment conditions. However, when catchment
        modelling systems are used for design flood estimation, calibration to
        historical events is required and the catchment and floodplain
        conditions at the time of the historical event need to be considered
        particularly as these conditions may not be the same as present day
        conditions. In addition, if a number of events are to be used during
        the calibration process, changes to catchment conditions may occur
        between events.</para>

        <para>Conditions at each of the relevant historical points in time
        must be established and used in the model development; this is
        discussed in more detail in <xref linkend="book7"/>. Changes to
        conditions that may affect flood behaviour include dam construction,
        initial dam storage levels, dredging or siltation of river channels
        and particularly of river mouths, construction of levees and other
        associated flood mitigation works, road construction including the
        raising or duplication of roads, the realignment of road embankments,
        the construction of new culverts and/or bridges, upgraded drainage
        networks both in rural and urban environments, developments on the
        floodplain, the construction of new weirs or the removal of old weirs,
        different crop types or stage in the growing season, and others that
        have not been mentioned here. Depending upon the length of time since
        the occurrence of the calibration event, record of these changes may
        be only available anecdotally.</para>

        <para>The availability of data for historical events needs to be
        considered when the event is used as part of the design flood
        estimation. For example, there may be anecdotal or even good formal
        measurement evidence of a record flood that occurred 100 years ago but
        details of this flood event may not be adequate for its use as a
        calibration event for validation of a catchment modelling system. On
        the other hand, the data may be adequate for it to be included as a
        high discharge censored event in a flood frequency analysis (<xref

        from the rainfall.</para>

        <para>Soil property data is available spatially for the whole country
        from the Atlas of Australian Soils (Mckenzie et al., 2000); this
        information is available in a GIS format from the Australian Soil
        Resource Information System website. These maps are broad scale
        (typically 1:250000 - 1:500000) and were completed between 1960 and
        1968. State based maps are available, also. Care should be taken when
        using soil maps as variations in soil over short distances occur
        frequently and cannot be resolved by the reconnaissance style mapping
        used in their development (Mckenzie et al., 2000).</para>

        <para>While it is possible to estimate land subject to inundation by
        floods through consideration of the soils and geomorphology, this does
        not provide any guidance on the likelihood of the flood hazard and
        therefore can be misleading. Furthermore, there is a need to ensure
        that the soil and geomorphoric data is obtained at a fine scale to
        ensure spatial variations over short distances are adequately
        recognised when using soil information to assess potential flood
        hazard.</para>

        <title>Data Collected at a Gauging Station</title>

        <para>There are many different approaches to collection of data at a
        stream gauging station. As stated previously, the purpose of a gauging
        station is to collect data about the time history of discharge at that
        point in the catchment drainage network. In general, the data
        collected consists of the gauge heights, sometimes referred to as
        stages. These gauge heights are used as the independent variable in a
        stage-discharge relationship to estimate the discharge at that point
        in time. Reliability of the discharge record is dependent on the
        accuracy and precision of the gauge-height record as well as the
        accuracy and precision of the stage-discharge relationship.</para>

        <para>Gauge-height records may be obtained by systematic observation
        of a non-recording gauge, or with automatic water level sensors and
        recorders. Furthermore, various types of transmitting systems are used
        to relay gauge-height information from remote gauging stations to
        storage databases.</para>

        <para>New technology, especially in the field of electronics and
        computer based management of field data, has led to a number of
        innovations in sensing, recording, and transmitting gauge height data.
        In the past the majority of gauging stations used floats in stilling
        wells as the primary method of sensing gauge height. Floats and
        stilling wells are still in common use today. However, the current
        trend is toward the use of submersible or non-submersible pressure
        transducers which do not require a stilling well. Additionally,
        electronic data recorders and various transmission systems are being
        used more extensively.</para>

        <para>Details of the instruments and associated structures for a
        stream gauging station are outlined by ISO (1983), Rantz (1982), and
        WMO (2010) and hence are not repeated herein. Nonetheless, users of
        stream discharge data for design flood estimation should ensure that
        they are conversant with the instruments and structures employed for
        the collection of streamflow data.</para>

        <title>Stage-Discharge Relationships</title>

        <para>The conversion of a record of gauge-height to a record of
        discharge is through use of a stage-discharge relationship. The
        physical element or combination of elements that maintains the
        relation is known as a control. One major classification of controls
        differentiates between section controls and channel controls. Another
        classification differentiates between natural and artificial controls.
        Artificial controls are structures built for the specific purpose of
        controlling the stage-discharge relation, such as a weir, flume, or
        small dam. A third classification differentiates between complete,
        partial and compound controls.</para>

        <para>The two attributes of a satisfactory control are stability and
        sensitivity. If the control is stable the stage-discharge relationship
        will be stable. If the control is subject to change, the
        stage-discharge relationship will be subject to change and frequent
        discharge measurements will be required for the continual
        re-calibration of the stage-discharge relationship. This increases the
        operating cost of the gauging station and also increases the
        uncertainty of streamflow records extracted from the database.
        Additional data about controls can be found in Herschy (1995).</para>

        <para>The traditional way in which a stage discharge relationship is
        derived for a particular gauging station is the measurement of
        discharge at convenient times. Traditionally, this measurement is
        undertaken with a current meter measuring the discharge velocity at
        enough points over the river cross section so that the discharge rate
        can be obtained for that particular stage. By taking such measurements
        for a number of different stages and corresponding discharges over a
        period of time, a number of points can be plotted on a stage-discharge
        diagram, and a curve drawn through those points, giving what is hoped
        to be a unique relationship between stage and discharge, the stage
        discharge relationship, as shown in <xref linkend="b1_ch4_f_tlc1u"/>.
        This rating curve is used in a manner whereby the routinely measured
        stages are converted to discharges by assuming that the corresponding
        discharge can be obtained from the curve.</para>

        affecting the rating curve, or what he called a <emphasis>shifting

            effective roughness, so that friction is greater after the flood
            peak than before, so that the corresponding discharge for a given
            stage height will be less after the peak. This will also
            contribute to a flood event showing a looped curve on a stage
            discharge diagram as shown on <xref linkend="b1_ch4_f_5gqn1"/>.
            Both Simons and Richardson (1962) and Fenton and Keller (2001)
            have examined this phenomenon and presented approaches for dealing
            with this issue;</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Backwater effects - changes in the conditions downstream

          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Unsteadiness - in general the discharge will change rapidly
            during a flood, and the slope of the water surface will be
            different from that for a constant stage, depending on whether the
            discharge is increasing or decreasing. The effect of this is for
            the trajectory of a flood event to appear as a loop on a
            stage-discharge diagram as shown in <xref

        <para>In addition to these generic problems associated with the use of
        rating curves, there are several problems associated with the use of
        rating curves for prediction of a design flood characteristic. These
        include:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>The assumption of a unique relationship between stage and
            discharge, in general, is not justified;</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Discharge is rarely measured during a flood, and the quality
            of data at the high discharge end of the curve typically is quite
            poor. As a result estimation of the peak discharge of a flood
            event usually involves extrapolation of the stage-discharge
            relationship beyond the recorded data points;</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>The relationship is usually a line of best fit through the
            data points defining the stage-discharge relationship. The
            approach recommended for estimation of this line of best fit in
            many guidance documents (see, for example, WMO 2010) is a visual
            fit. This approach provides minimal data on the uncertainty of the
            relationship and the reliability of any extrapolation of the
            relationship. This limits the estimation of the propagation of the
            uncertainty in the flood characteristic prediction approach;
            and</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>It has to describe a range of variation from no discharge
            through small but typical discharges to very large extreme flood
            events.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>As highlighted in the previous discussion, the unsteadiness of the discharge during a
          flood event (i.e. the variation of discharge with time) and its influence on a discharge
          estimate is ignored in the traditional application of a rating curve. In a flood event the
          slope of the water surface for a given stage will be different from that for the same
          stage during steady flow conditions; this difference will depend on whether the discharge
          is increasing or decreasing. As the flood increases, the surface slope in the river is
          greater than the slope for steady flow at the same stage, and hence, according to
          conventional hydraulic theory more water is flowing down the river than the rating curve
          would suggest. The effect of this is shown in <xref linkend="b1_ch4_f_5gqn1"/>. When the
          water level is falling, the slope and, hence, the discharge inferred is less. The effects
          <?oxy_delete author="RadhikaChhotai" timestamp="20151007T225609+1100" content="of this "?>might
          be important - the peak discharge could be significantly underestimated during highly
          dynamic floods, and also since the maximum discharge and maximum stage do not coincide,
          the arrival time of the peak discharge could be in error and may influence flood warning
          predictions. Finally, the use of a discharge hydrograph derived inaccurately by using a
          single-valued rating relationship may distort estimates for resistance coefficients during
          calibration of an unsteady flow model.</para>

        <para>It might be expected by practitioners that good instructions and
        guidance would be provided by the International and Australian
        Standards (AS3778.2.3-2001), which are the same, the latter being a
        reproduction of the former. Another source of guidance is provided by
        WMO (2010). However, Fenton and Keller (2001) state:</para>

        <para><emphasis>“the Standards seem confusing and poorly prepared. In
        many places they state the obvious, but where sophisticated or modern
        methods are required, they have almost no serious guidance for
        practical implementation.”.</emphasis></para>

        <para>Despite these issues, stage-discharge relationships form a
        foundation for the generation of the data necessary for the prediction
        of design flood characteristics.</para>

        <title>Extrapolation of Stage-Discharge Relationships</title>

        <para>The stage-discharge relationship can be considered to consist of

          <listitem>
            <para>An interpolation zone where the relationship is within the

        </itemizedlist>

        <para>While it is preferable that all stage measurements are within
        the interpolation zone, the nature of the data needed for design flood
        estimation, and for flood prediction in general, the reliability of
        data from measurements within the extrapolation zone will require
        consideration of the extrapolation methodology. The need for
        extrapolation is shown in <xref linkend="b1_ch4_f_a160s"/> where the
        discharges for the Annual Maxima Series extracted for Stream Gauge
        222202<emphasis role="bold"> </emphasis>are plotted as a function of
        the rating ratio (the rating ratio is the ratio of the recorded
        discharge to the highest gauging used to develop the stage-discharge
        relationship). All points in the Annual Maxima Series where the rating
        ratio is greater than 1 require use of the extrapolation zone of the
        stage-discharge relationship.</para>

          </figure>As shown in <xref linkend="b1_ch4_f_a160s"/>, a number of
        the values in the Annual Maxima Series are in the extrapolation zone.
        The accuracy of the values in the extrapolation zone has the potential
        to influence fitting of the statistical model to the Annual Maxima
        Series, thereby influencing the predicted design flood quantiles.
        Fitting a statistical model to data points where the higher values are
        subject to estimate errors is discussed in <xref
        linkend="b3_ch2"/>.</para>

        <para>There are a number of alternative techniques for development of
        the extrapolation zone of the stage-discharge relationship. The
        guidance provided by the International and Australian Standards is
        limited; a recommendation that a logarithmic extrapolation be used is
        included in the guidance. However, there is a recognition that
        extrapolation using logarithmic techniques needs to be confirmed
        through investigation of the station conditions.</para>

        <para>An alternative approach that has developed since development of
        computer based modelling systems is the use of a hydraulic model to
        develop the extrapolation zone of the stage-discharge relationship.
        Similar to the application of a logarithmic technique, the suitability
        of this approach needs to be confirmed prior to its application. Of
        particular concern is the modelling of the energy losses associated
        with flow in the channel and adjacent floodplains where it is
        necessary to assume that the parameter values obtained during
        calibration are suitable for the larger discharges being simulated in
        the extrapolation zone of the stage-discharge relationship.</para>

        <para>The important point in this discussion, however, is a
        recognition that the values of the data extracted from a discharge
        record for fitting of a statistical model will contain values where
        the conversion of the recorded level to an equivalent discharge
        occurred through extrapolation of the stage-discharge relationship.
        Consideration of this in the fitting of a statistical model to the
        Annual Maxima Series is discussed later in <xref

        <title>Uncertainty of Discharge Measurements</title>

        <para>The accuracy, or uncertainty, of a discharge measurement is very
        important for purposes of assessing the quality and reliability of
        that measurement. The concept of error and error analysis is a
        long-standing practice in the field of hydraulics and hydrology. The
        concept of uncertainty, however, is relatively new. Nonetheless,
        methods for evaluating, defining and expressing the uncertainty of
        streamflow measurements have developed.</para>

        <para>Uncertainty and accuracy are terms that are sometimes used interchangeably even though
          they have two very distinct meanings. Accuracy (or error) refers to the agreement, or
          disagreement, between the measurement of stream discharge and the true or correct value of
          the discharge at the time of measurement.

        <para>The uncertainty of a discharge measurement, on the other hand, acknowledges that no

          the dispersion of values that could reasonably be attributed to the measurement. It is
          typically expressed as a range of values in which the measurement value is estimated to
          lie, within a given statistical confidence. It does not attempt to define or rely on a
          unique true value.

        categorised as:</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>Measurement - these are the uncertainties associated with
            taking the measurements. The primary component in this category is
