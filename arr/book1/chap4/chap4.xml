    <para>Routine data collection programmes are important, but it is often valuable to expend some
      effort in finding and verifying other data for particular projects. It is also important to
      note that data useful for these projects may be anecdotal rather than formal and often
      valuable information can be gathered by simply holding discussions with local residents or
      other stakeholders. Many projects have a consultation programme

      water resources in Australia are often scarce and are therefore critical to the nation’s
      prosperity. At the other end of the scale, large floods often cause devastating damage to
      property and endanger lives. While present generations are benefiting from the data collection
      activities of our predecessors, it is our responsibility to ensure that future generations are
      not disadvantaged by the changes we are implementing now. Data collection is about reducing

    <title>Stationarity</title>
    <para>Detection of changes in river discharge and magnitude of flood peaks, whether it is abrupt
      or gradual change is of considerable importance, being fundamental for planning of future
      water resources and flood protection (Kundzewicz, 2004). Generally flood analysis and planning
      design rules, including data collection programmes, are based on the assumption of stationary
      hydrological data sets. If the stationarity assumption is proved to be invalid through global
      climate change then the existing procedures for designing water-related infrastructures will
      need revision. This has been recognized in the US with increased emphasis on maintaining
      stations with long data records (NRC, 2004). Long data sets and ongoing analysis are essential
      to promote accurate design of systems to perform adequately for their design probability and
      not be over designed resulting in higher costs or

      it is recognised that with the “greenhouse effect” analyses might need to take into account
      the non-stationary effects when performing hydrologic designs. There is therefore a
      demonstrated need to continue data collection to avoid potential large errors in hydraulic
      structures design and water resources management due to inadequate streamflow data. (Wain

        streamflow or rainfall data collected on a routine basis by major government agencies such
        as the Bureau of Meteorology. This data is collected to provide a long term understanding of
        Australia’s climatic conditions for a representative selection of sites throughout the

      <title>Data source organisations</title>
      <para>Data can be obtained from a wide range of organisations and individuals, and effort
        expended in sourcing and checking all available flood data and information is worthwhile.
        Data can be sources from a number of immediately obvious organisations, but can also be
        found from others that may not be so obvious.</para>
      <para>Major water authorities, such as the Bureau of Meteorology and state water agencies are
        immediately obvious sources, and these organisations are expected to hold most of the data
        from formal data collection programmes. These agencies generally have well designed
        websites, where data can be reviewed and downloaded, and almost all data required for flood
        investigations can usually be downloaded from these agency websites for no charge.</para>
      <para>Other sources include.</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Local authorities. Councils are responsible for planning process and flooding is an
            important constraint to their planning. Councils therefore usually hold historical data
            on flood levels as well as other observations.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Transport agencies. The major state government road and rail agencies, as well as
            privatised road and rail organisations usually hold extensive data on flooding as it
            affects their infrastructure.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Other government agencies. Activities of other agencies such as those responsible
            for the primary industries, environment or mining are impacted by flooding and they will
            often hold flood or other meteorological data relevant to flooding.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Commercial organisations. Mining or agribusiness companies require flood data as it
            affects their activities and may hold relevant data.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Farmers and graziers. The weather is critical to agricultural industries and many
            farmers operate a raingauge and can at least provide data for major storm events, but
            they may also hold flood records as they affect their irrigation performance for
            example.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Individuals. Many individuals have an interest in flooding especially if it affects
            them so flood levels and other observations can often be obtained from individual
            property owners.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Others. There may be specific stakeholders who could supply flood data for a
            particular flood investigation, and these can vary depending on the actual project and
            location.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>In general therefore, it is important to search widely for flood data during projects.
        Even anecdotal information will usually be of value in setting model parameters and
        improving local understanding of flood conditions.</para>

      <para>This information is particularly important for most projects, and can often provide a
        significant improvement in the quality of the analysis. While data on historical floods may
        be difficult to obtain at times, efforts expended in finding and analysing this data is
        extremely valuable.</para>
      <para>There are two types of data referred to here. These are:</para>
      <para>
        <variablelist>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>Significant events.</term>
            <listitem>
              <para>If a major event occurs, it is important for the Bureau of Meteorology, Council
                or other appropriate agency to collect as much relevant information as possible soon
                after the event and publish this, even if only in an internal report. Because major
                events occur rarely and unexpectedly, it is often difficult to mobilise the
                resources in time and appropriately. As well it may not always be obvious that this
                data will be useful, so there may not be an immediate interest in the data
                collection. The Bureau of Meteorology produce reports following major events and
                these reports usually contain information that is very helpful in particular
                projects.</para>
            </listitem>
          </varlistentry>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>Historical events.</term>
            <listitem>
              <para>Where especially significant events have occurred in past, there are often
                historical records of the event. These records may be in reports by relevant
                government agencies, but often there may be useful information in newspaper reports,
                historical societies or museums or information can be gathered from old long term
                residents. Particularly significant events such as the Clermont storm of 1916 and
                the Brisbane floods of 1893 have good published data, but other events may be more
                difficult to locate.</para>
            </listitem>
          </varlistentry>
          <varlistentry>
            <term>"Routine" flood data.</term>
            <listitem>
              <para>As well as the major events noted above, data on more routine (though still
                large) events can be sourced from discussions with residents and other stakeholders.
                This data is usually descriptive, but often actual flood levels can be surveyed
                based on the data held by residents and flood marks on buildings and elsewhere. This
                data is especially useful if there has been a major flood in reasonably recent
                times, and local residents can recall details. Photos or videos can be obtained as
                part of these programmes.</para>
            </listitem>
          </varlistentry>
        </variablelist>
      </para>
      <para>The accuracy of this type of data may be extremely variable and careful review and
        checking is essential. The requirements for checking are difficult to specify, but the
        checks should involve review of the consistency between individual data points and a general
        check of "reasonableness".</para>
      <para>Usually this type of data is of variable quality, but with careful collection and
        checking, is almost always very valuable in implementation of projects.</para>
      <para>As well as "numerical data", other less formal data can be collected for historical
        events. These can include photos or videos taken during the flood or eye witness
        descriptions and accounts. While this type of information may not be directly applicable for
        model calibration, it is invaluable in many applications to ensure that the model is
        representing the general flow conditions and distribution.</para>
      <para>This type of data is often sourced from local residents during consultation programmes,
        when the flood specialist specifically searches for it.</para>

          This distinction between the terms is consistent with Beynon-Davies (2002) who uses the
          concept of a sign to distinguish between data and information; data are symbols while
          information occurs when symbols are used to refer to something.</para>

          <para><emphasis>Storage</emphasis> - The storage of the data is performed in this

            of the data into a digital database. It is important to note that the manner of data
            storage should ensure that its retrieval is both practical and feasible. If retrieval is
            not easy, there is no addition to the data available for design flood estimation.</para>
          <para>There are many different forms of data stored in a database which in turn influences
            the data storage design. Commonly, spatial databases are referred to as Geographic
            Information Systems (GIS) while databases used to store temporal data can be referred to
            as a Time-Series Managers (TSM). These computerised storage facilities have superseded,
            in general, the previous techniques based on data storage through maps and charts. There
            are a large number of alternative GISs and TSMs that can be used for data storage. It is
            not the purpose of Australian Rainfall and Runoff to recommend a particular GIS or TSM
            but rather to note their use for storing data relevant to design flood
            estimation.</para>
          <para>Since 2008, the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) has been responsible for delivering
            water data throughout Australia. As part of this role, the BoM has been collecting water
            data from more than 200 organisations across the nation and is using this data to report
            on water availability, condition and use in a nationally consistent way. To facilitate
            this role, the BoM is building the Australian Water Resources Information System (AWRIS)
            as a secure repository for water data and as a means to deliver high quality water data
            to all Australians.</para>

            will be able to merge historical water data records with current observations to suit a
            variety of user needs. By spatially enabling this data we will be able to query and
            report the data in many different ways. Data stored in AWRIS will be delivered to the
            web, to mobile devices and various hydrologic forecasting systems to be operated by the
            BoM.</para>

          <para><emphasis>Analysis</emphasis> - It is common that analysis of data will be required.
            The analysis techniques form this component of the data cycle. The steps involved in
            this component can be summarised as data retrieval, and data usage. It is worth noting
            that the data obtained from the analysis could be considered as part of the data
            generation component. Hence there is some similarity between the generation and analysis
            components.</para>
          <para>There are many alternative analysis techniques. For design flood estimation
            purposes, the most commonly used analysis techniques would be statistical modelling (for
            example, flood frequency analysis) and catchment response modelling using a catchment
            modelling system. Both of these techniques result in the generation of additional data

            The technical level of the presented data would not be constant for all presentations

While data on historical floods may be difficult to obtain at times,, efforts expended in finding and analysing these data are extremely valuable. Regardless of the quality of the data, predicted design flood characteristics will be improved through consideration of historical data.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Typically, information on the historical flood behaviour is collected immediately after the event but often this information is not collated until there is a need for the data. Historical flood data, therefore, will have differing reliability, which ; this needs to should be considered when the data is used as part of the analysis. Nonetheless, all historical flood data will assist in the estimation of design flood characteristics.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;With all historical flood behaviour data, the modeller must consider the nature of the collected data when making an assessingment of the reliability of the point and the its priority it has during the calibration process.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The methods developed for ARR use historical data of the types discussed.

      <para>Rainfall is a primary data input for almost all water resources projects, and rainfall
        data forms the basic input to the development of the rainfall chapters in "Australian
        Rainfall and Runoff" as well as a key input to other components.</para>
      <para>The Bureau of Meteorology is the primary agency responsible for collection of rainfall
        data in Australia, but there are many other agencies which have significant records of
        rainfall data. The other agencies include local authorities and water agencies, but some
        organisations have particular local data programmes that may be useful in specific projects.
        As well rainfall data can be collected from various sources for major historical floods as
        discussed further below.</para>
      <para>In many major flood events, it is often valuable to look for unofficial rain gauges
        where data has been collected by members of the public. In rural areas, most property owners
        have rain gauges and they are also not unusual in towns and cities.</para>
      <para>Data endorsed by the Bureau can be regarded as accurate, but some checks for consistency
        and the reasonableness of the data should also be carried out. In particular, tests for
        missing (accumulated) data need to be considered but it is also possible that gauge
        overflows mean that the larger events are not well measured. Data from other agencies may be
        also of a high standard, but these agencies sometimes have poorer quality data. More careful
        checks are needed on this data. Data collected at unofficial rain gauges operated by members
        of the public may be sometimes of very poor quality, with poor exposure for example, and
        records from these sources must be checked very carefully. However the value of this data
        means that it is often worth further analysis to ensure that useful data is not discarded.
        Data from unofficial gauges is especially important for major events where it can be used to
        supplement information from official gauges.</para>
      <para>Most publicly available rainfall data should be available through the BoM’s AWRIS

      <title>Rainfall Observations</title>
      <para>The standard instrument for manual measurement of rainfall is the 203mm rain gauge (see
          <xref linkend="b1_ch4_f_vx3ga"/>). In essence, this instrument is a circular funnel, with
        a diameter of 203mm and the top located 0.3m above the ground surface,that collects the rain
        into a graduated and calibrated cylinder. Any excess precipitation is captured in the outer
        metal cylinder. Most manually read gauges are used for daily observations.</para>
      <para>Daily rainfall is nominally measured each day at 9:00 am local time. At most rainfall
        sites, observations are taken by volunteers who send in a monthly record of daily
        precipitation at the end of each month. A subset of observers at strategic locations, as
        well as automatic weather stations, send observations electronically to the BoM each day.
        Very few stations have a complete unbroken record of climate information. Missed
        observations may be due to observer illness or equipment failure. If, for some reason, an
        observation is unable to be made, the next observation is recorded as an accumulation, since
        the rainfall has been accumulating in the rain gauge since the last reading.</para>

        </figure>An alternative to the manual measurement is to use a continuous recording rain
        gauge resulting in either an analogue chart record or a digital record. While some chart
        recorders remain in operation, the more common form of continuous rain gauges is the Tipping
        Bucket Rain Gauge (see <xref linkend="b1_ch4_f_6l2nu"/>). Like the manual rain gauge, the
        aperture of the funnel for a TBRG is 203 mm.</para>

        rate at which the rain is falling. Operation of a TBRG is based on the generation of an
        electronic pulse when the water volume collected in the bucket results in bucket tipping.
        While the usual volume of water collected is equivalent to a depth of 0.2mm, some early
        TBRGs required a depth of 0.5mm before the bucket would tip. When analysing data from TBRGs,
        users should check the bucket size to ensure the validity of the analysis; this information
        should be available from the meta-data attached to the recorded data.</para>
      <para>Traditionally rainfall is measured to the nearest 0.2mm (prior to 1974 records were in
        Imperial units and measurements were to the nearest 1 point, approximately 0.25mm). However,
        in recent years some observations have been reported to 0.1mm. Hence, users check the
        meta-data attached to the data records to note the measurement accuracy rather than the
        inferred accuracy from the database records.</para>

      <title>Review of Rainfall Data</title>
      <para>While rainfall data is frequently regarded as reliable and accurate, there are some

        while applying data to practical applications. Issues often encountered are.</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Accumulated records. Rainfall data, especially from daily read gauges may have
            missing days of record. In some cases, these missing days are simply not recorded while
            on other occasions, the total for a number of days is accumulated. This occurs since
            thee rainfall is collected in the raingauge and several days record are recorded on a
            single day at the end of the accumulated period. These records need to be reviewed in
            conjunction with records from neighbouring gauges and adjustments made as necessary.
            Accumulated records may give an excessively high daily record for the day where the
            records are accumulated.</para>

        <title>Australian Data Archive for Meteorology</title>
        <para>The Australian Data Archive for Meteorology (ADAM) stores meteorological observations
          from observing systems over mainland Australia and from neighbouring islands, the
          Antarctic, ships and ocean buoys that are operated by the BoM. It also stores a limited
          number of observations from other local and international sources to support research and
          improve BoM services.</para>
        <para>The most common observation type stored in ADAM is daily rainfall. Dating back to the
          mid-1800s, these total more than 200 million records from a network of over 16000
          locations. Other types of weather data that are stored in ADAM include air temperature,
          humidity, wind velocity, sunshine, cloud cover, soil temperatures, upper atmospheric wind
          and temperature, and observed weather phenomena (for example, thunder, frost and
          dust).</para>
        <para>To support this large database, the ADAM system contains supporting database tables
          and software tools required to enter, retrieve and quality control data efficiently. A set
          of detailed rules and procedures ensure consistent treatment of information.</para>

        <title>Australian Water Resources Information System</title>
        <para>The BoM is building the AWRIS as a secure repository for water data and as a means to
          deliver high quality water information to all Australians. Under the Water Regulations
          2008, the BoM receives information about river discharges and groundwater levels, water
          volumes in storage, water quality in rivers and aquifers, water use and restrictions,
          water entitlements and water trades. The intention is that AWRIS will store and manage
          this data in a central database.</para>
        <para>To achieve this aim, AWRIS is a powerful hydroinformatic system capable of receiving,
          standardising, organising and interpreting water data from across the nation. The
          Australian Hydrological Geospatial Fabric (also known as the Geofabric refer to <xref
            linkend="b1_ch4_s_2cgbg"/>) is a vital component of AWRIS. It is a specialised
          Geographic Information System that enables a spatial context to the data stored within
          AWRIS. With this spatial context, the utility of water data of the data will be enhanced
          through ease of access. Additionally, the Geofabric encodes the spatial connections and
          relationships between most of Australia’s hydrological features including rivers, dams,
          lakes, aquifers, diversions, supply channels, drains and monitoring points. Distribution
          of the data stored in AWRIS is through the BoM website and Water Online.</para>

        <title>Gridded Rainfall Data</title>
        <para>In addition to the recorded rainfall data from rain gauges located in and near the
          catchment, the Bureau of Meteorology publish a grid of daily rainfall data for the whole
          of Australia covering a period from 1900 to date. This is a component of the Australian
          Water Availability Project (AWAP) Jones et al., 2007; Raupach et al., 2009. This grid is
          at a resolution of approximately 5 km (0.05 degrees) and includes daily rainfall value for
          each grid cell for each day from 1900. The quality of the grid points varies depending on
          the period of interest since there is a better coverage of gauges in more recent times.
          The quality also varies depending on the location, with less accurate records for
          locations with high rainfall gradients and for less populated regions where there is a
          more sparse gauge density.</para>

However, neither form of historical streamflow data should be considered error- free and users need to be cognisant of the likely magnitudes of these errors.

Wwhere a rating curve exists, these can be converted to discharge. Flow is derived from stage using a stage-discharge relationship and it is critical that the maximum gauged flow is known so that the extent of extrapolation underlying the ‘recorded’ flow is clear (refer to &lt;xref linkend=&quot;b1_ch4_s_brxk2&quot;/&gt;). These records are very important as, if intact, they will show the complete hydrograph (i.e. the rise, peak and fall of the flood). Historical records for continuous water level recorders are typically stored by government agencies and one needs to be careful . Care needs to be taken with the datum of these records as they are typically not to AHD (Australian Height Datum) and some conversion may be required. In case of large events, these recorders can fail and the data needs to be inspected for “&apos;flat&apos;” areas, which may indicate failure of the gauge or they may rise steeply if in case of a landslip occurs at the gauge site.. Typically, each stage record has an accuracy code assigned and these should be noted before use.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Early water level records are manually read, either once daily or . This may be once daily and supplemented with additional readings during the event.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section xml:id=&quot;b1_ch4_s_v4u99&quot;&gt;&lt;title&gt;Maximum Height Gauges&lt;/title&gt;&lt;para&gt;Maximum height gauges simply record the peak flood level reached during a particular event. Again, data are is held by a government agency and care should be taken one needs to be careful while converting the gauge datum to AHD. Failure of these gauges is difficult to detect as they are simply recording the peak level., and Iif the gauge fails before the peak of an event, it may still provide a “&apos;peak level&apos;” value, but it which will be the refer the flood level reached prior to the peak at the time of gauge failure. Time of peak is sometimes also available, and however, it is recommended that this is checked to ensure that the peak was recorded at approximately the correct time.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section xml:id=&quot;b1_ch4_s_yn46c&quot;&gt;&lt;title&gt;Peak Level Records&lt;/title&gt;&lt;para&gt;If the flood event has been of a significant nature, it is likely that government agencies have been able to collect some actual flood levels at a variety of locations. This is typically done by mobilising agency staff to place markers (paint, stakes, nails, surveyor’s tape) either indicating maximum flood extent (e.g. spray paint on a road, stake in ground) or peak flood levels (e.g. nail in a tree). Ideally, each marker should have the time and the staff member’s name recorded at the marker site as well. Following the event, surveyors can measure x,y location data and z flood level data at each of these markers. It is also useful to photograph the site and to record ground level. Surveyors should also include the time at which the markers were placed, by whom and type (e.g. nail in tree) in their metadatameta-data. Residents often also record peak flood levels, particularly if the flood has inundated any buildings on their property. Post event flood levels can be collected by residents by a questionnaire and reliable marks surveyed. An assessment as to the reliability of these levels can only be made after viewing the marks themselves and noting the care with which the recording has been made. Have different event dates been recorded by the resident or is the resident relying on memory to determine one event from another? Has the location of the marks changed in any way since the record was made? For example, if the marks are made near the front door, has the house been raised at any time since? Detailed discussion with the resident can often unearth important details otherwise unknown.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section xml:id=&quot;b1_ch4_s_gjizs&quot;&gt;&lt;title&gt;Debris Marks&lt;/title&gt;&lt;para&gt;Debris marks are best measured as soon as possible after the event, when the debris or scum line is still fresh. This ensures that the mark is attributable to the event of interest. The longer it takes the surveyor to measure the mark, the more chance there is for errors as debris marks may be from an older event or an event in a tributary rather than the main channel of interest. Debris marks can be inaccurate for a number of reasons. They can be influenced by dynamic hydraulic effects such as waves, eddies, pressure surges, bores or transient effects, which may not be accounted for in the model. For example, if the debris mark is located within a region of fast flowing floodwater it is possible that the floodwater has pushed the debris up against an obstacle, lodging it at a higher level than the surrounding flood level. More common though is the fact that debris often lodges at a level lower than the peak flood level. The reason for this is that for debris to be deposited it needs to have somewhere to lodge and this elevation is not always at the peak flood level. For example, the classic place for debris lodgement is a barbwire fence with horizontal strands of wire. If the flood level almost reached the top strand of barbwire, debris will not lodge in the top strand but rather on the second from top strand, which may be about 0.3m lower than the peak flood level. It is recommended that the surveyor be asked to record as much information as possible about the mark itself (e.g. debris on barbwire fence spacing 0.35m) so the modeller is able to consider reasons for discrepancies in the calibration process, if they arise.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section xml:id=&quot;b1_ch4_s_yiylp&quot;&gt;&lt;title&gt;Anecdotal Information&lt;/title&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;emphasis&gt;Anecdotal&lt;/emphasis&gt; information is usually qualitative in nature but can be very valuable in determining flow behaviour and subsequently verifying that the model behaves in a similar manner. Photograph and video evidence can also be beneficial in this regard and can often assist long-term residents remember details of historical floods long past. The modeller will need to be mindful of the fact that memories can sometimes fade or be skewed by other events that have occurred between particularly when several floods occur close together. In addition, information providers may not be able to provide unbiased information due to a vested interest (e.g. pride or financial gain etc) in the level to which an historic event reached. Again, detailed discussions with residents and stakeholders can provide the modeller with a general feel for the reliability of all anecdotal evidence. Inconsistent facts have to be identified and discarded and discrepancies have to be studied and explained.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/section&gt;"?>

      <para>Water level data is a principal data type, and as well as being used in its own right,
        is also used to calculate streamflow data.</para>
      <para>A major source of water level data is at formal stream flow stations operated by the
        major water authorities. This data is usually converted into streamflow data as discussed
        further below, but there are some locations where only water level data is collected or
        published. Water authorities publish data and it is usually freely available. The published
        data usually has an indication of the accuracy and completeness, but some checking is
        needed.</para>
      <para>In addition, there are many stations, especially those operated by the Bureau of
        Meteorology and local authorities, mainly for flood forecasting and warning, where stream
        flows are not calculated and water levels only are available. The larger agencies usually
        make this data available, sometimes on line.</para>
      <para>Water level data may be in the form of continuous records monitored by an automatic
        recorder or as manually read records. Most of the earlier records were manually read at
        staff gauges, but many of these are now replaced by automatic water level recorders.
        Manually read records were usually recorded once a day with supplementary more frequent
        readings during flood events. Because of the rapid response of many streams, the manually
        read records may not provide the peak levels and may even totally miss short duration flood
        events. Manually read records are usually better quality for large slowly responding streams
        and this data can be used with confidence, but smaller catchments may be significantly in
        error. More often than not, manually read records show smaller flood peaks and lower
        discharges than automatic recorders. However practically all records from before the 1960s
        are manually read, so this data forms the only available information for long term stations.
        Therefore data from manually read stations is usually the only available record and has to
        be used, but careful consideration is needed to make sure the records are interpreted
        correctly.</para>
      <para>In addition to the formal water level records, informal records can also be obtained
        usually following a major flood event. These records are usually obtained by a Council or
        other stakeholder who sends surveyors on-site soon after an event to survey flood marks to
        indicate the maximum water levels reached. This data provides an indication of the variation
        of water levels across the floodplain and an indication of the flow patterns. The quality of
        this data may sometimes be questionable, and the records need to be carefully checked. These
        checks can include checking for consistency and reasonableness as well as a review of the
        reliability of the agency or person who has collected the data. When this type of data is
        collected, it is important that the records include careful descriptions of the
        circumstances of the collection and an indication of the expected accuracy.</para>
      <para>Common concerns with this data is the level of observed debris marks, whether the water
        levels have been collected at the peak level of the flood and the source of the water level,
        either local drainage or backwater for example. Therefore while very useful data can be
        obtained, it must be carefully reviewed otherwise the data may lead to incorrect conclusions
        in the resulting analysis.</para>
      <para>However water levels are often only used as the source of streamflow or discharge data,
        as discussed below, and while water levels are useful in many applications, streamflow data
        is usually of far greater value for many water resources studies.</para>

        <title>Continuous Water Level Recorders</title>
        <para>Continuous water level recorders measure water levels at nominated intervals and,
          where a rating curve (stage-discharge relationship) exists, these can be converted to
          discharge. Flow is derived from stage using a stage-discharge relationship and it is
          critical that maximum gauged flow is known so that the extent of extrapolation underlying
          the ‘recorded’ flow is clear (refer to <xref linkend="b1_ch4_s_brxk2"/>). These records
          are very important as,

          intact, they will show the complete hydrograph <?oxy_comment_end?>(i.e. the rise, peak and
          fall of the flood). Historical records for continuous water level recorders are typically
          stored by government agencies and one needs to be careful with the datum of these records
          as may not be to AHD (Australian Height Datum) and some conversion may be required. In
          case of large events, these recorders can fail and the data needs to be inspected for
          'flat' areas, which may indicate failure of the gauge or they may rise steeply in case of
          a landslip occurs. Typically, each stage record has an accuracy code assigned and these
          should be noted before use.</para>

        <title>Maximum Height Gauges</title>
        <para>Maximum height gauges simply record the peak flood level reached during a particular
          event. Again, data is often held by a government agency and one needs to be careful while
          converting the gauge datum to AHD. Failure of these gauges is difficult to detect as they
          are simply recording the peak level, and if the gauge fails before the peak of an event,
          it may still provide a 'peak level' value, which will refer the flood level reached prior
          to the peak at the time of gauge failure. Time of peak is sometimes also available,
          however, it is recommended that this is checked to ensure that the peak was recorded at
          approximately the correct time.</para>

      <section xml:id="b1_ch4_s_yn46c">
        <title>Peak Level Records</title>
        <para>If the flood event has been of a significant nature, it is likely that stakeholders
          have been able to collect some actual flood levels at a variety of locations. This is
          typically done by mobilising agency staff to place markers (paint, stakes, nails,
          surveyor’s tape) either indicating maximum flood extent (e.g. spray paint on a road, stake
          in ground) or peak flood levels (e.g. nail in a tree). Ideally, each marker should have
          the time and the staff member’s name recorded at the marker site. Following the event,
          surveyors can measure x,y location data and z flood level data at each of these markers.
          It is also useful to photograph the site and to record ground level. Surveyors should also
          include the time at which the markers were placed, by whom and type (e.g. nail in tree) in
          their meta-data. Residents often also record peak flood levels, particularly if the flood
          has inundated any buildings on their property. Post event flood levels can be collected by
          residents by a questionnaire and reliable marks surveyed. An assessment as to the
          reliability of these levels can only be made after viewing the marks themselves and noting
          the care with which the recording has been made. Have different event dates been recorded
          by the resident or is the resident relying on memory to determine one event from another?
          Has the location of the marks changed in any way since the record was made? For example,
          if the marks are made near the front door, has the house been raised at any time since?
          Detailed discussion with the resident can often unearth important details otherwise
          unknown.</para>

      <section xml:id="b1_ch4_s_gjizs">
        <title>Debris Marks</title>
        <para>Debris marks are a typical means of measuring the maximum flood level and are best
          measured as soon as possible after the event, when the debris or scum line is still fresh.
          This ensures that the mark is attributable to the event of interest and has not been
          subsequently degraded.</para>
        <para>Debris marks can be inaccurate for a number of reasons. They can be influenced by
          dynamic hydraulic effects such as waves, eddies, pressure surges, bores or transient
          effects, which may not be accounted for in a hydraulic model. For example, if the debris
          mark is located within a region of fast flowing floodwater it is possible that the
          floodwater has pushed the debris up against an obstacle, lodging it at a higher level than
          the surrounding flood level. More common though is the fact that debris often lodges at a
          level lower than the peak flood level. The reason for this is that for debris to be
          deposited it needs to have somewhere to lodge and this elevation is not always at the peak
          flood level. For example, the classic place for debris lodgement is a barbwire fence with
          horizontal strands of wire. If the flood level almost reached the top strand of barbwire,
          debris will not lodge in the top strand but rather on the second from top strand, which
          may be about 0.3m lower than the peak flood level. It is recommended that the surveyor be
          asked to record as much information as possible about the mark itself (e.g. debris on
          barbwire fence spacing 0.35m) so the modeller is able to consider reasons for
          discrepancies in the calibration process, if they arise.</para>

      <section xml:id="b1_ch4_s_yiylp">
        <title>Anecdotal Information</title>
        <para>Anecdotal information is usually qualitative in nature but can be very valuable in
          determining flow behaviour and subsequently verifying that the flood analysis represents
          these observations in the hydraulic modelling undertaken. Photograph and video evidence
          can also be beneficial in this regard and can often assist long-term residents remember
          details of historical floods long past. The flood modeller will need to be mindful of the
          fact that memories can sometimes fade or be skewed by other events that have occurred
          particularly when several floods occur close together. In addition, information providers
          may not be able to provide unbiased information due to a vested interest (e.g. pride or
          financial gain etc) in the level to which an historic event reached. Again, detailed
          discussions with residents and stakeholders can provide the modeller with a general feel
          for the reliability of all anecdotal evidence. Inconsistent facts have to be identified
          and discarded and discrepancies have to be studied and explained.</para>

In essence, this instrument is a circular funnel, with a diameter of 203mm and the top located 0.3m above the ground surface,which that collects the rain into a graduated and calibrated cylinder. Any excess precipitation is captured in the outer metal cylinder. The top of the rain gauge (i.e. the top of the funnel) should be located 0.3m above the ground surface.. Most manually read gauges are used for daily observations.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Daily rainfall is nominally measured each day at 9:00 am local time. At the majority of rainfall sites, observations are taken by volunteers who send in a monthly record of daily precipitation at the end of each month. A subset of observers at strategic locations, as well as automatic weather stations, send observations electronically to the Bureau of MeteorologyBoM each day. Very few stations have a complete unbroken record of climate information. Missed observations may be due to observer illness or equipment failure. If, for some reason, an observation is unable to be made, the next observation is recorded as an accumulation, since the rainfall has been accumulating in the rain gauge since the last reading.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;figure xml:id=&quot;b1_ch4_f_vx3ga&quot;&gt;&lt;title&gt;Standard Rain Gauge (Source: Bureau of MeteorologyBoM)&lt;/title&gt;&lt;mediaobject&gt;&lt;imageobject&gt;&lt;imagedata fileref=&quot;../../figures/1009.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/imageobject&gt;&lt;/mediaobject&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;An alternative to the manual measurement is to use a continuous recording rain gauge resulting in either an analogue chart record or a digital record. While some chart recorders remain in operation, the more common form of continuous rain gauges is the Tipping Bucket Rain Gauge (see &lt;xref linkend=&quot;b1_ch4_f_6l2nu&quot;/&gt;). Like the manual rain gauge, the aperture of the funnel for a TBRG is 203 mm.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;figure xml:id=&quot;b1_ch4_f_6l2nu&quot;&gt;&lt;title&gt;Tipping Bucket Rain Gauge (Source: Bureau of Meteorology)&lt;/title&gt;&lt;mediaobject&gt;&lt;imageobject&gt;&lt;imagedata fileref=&quot;../../figures/1010.jpg&quot;/&gt;&lt;/imageobject&gt;&lt;/mediaobject&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;para&gt;Advantages of the TBRG are claimed to include unattended, automatic operation, and the ability to record the rate at which the rain is falling. Operation of a TBRG is based on the generation of an electronic pulse when the water volume of water collected in the bucket results in the bucket tipping. While the usual volume of water collected is equivalent to a depth of 0.2mm, some early TBRGs required a depth of 0.5mm before the bucket would tip. When analysing data from TBRGs, users should check the bucket size to ensure the validity of the analysis; this information should be available from the meta-data attached to the recorded data.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Traditionally rainfall is measured to the nearest 0.2mm (prior to 1974 records were in Imperial units and measurements were to the nearest 1 point). However, in recent years some observations have been reported to 0.1mm. Hence, users check the meta-data attached to the data records to note the measurement accuracy rather than the inferred accuracy from the database records.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The Bureau of MeteorologyBoM undertake a number of quality control processes to detect errors in the rainfall data forwarded from the many volunteer and professional readers.

Under the Water Regulations 2008, the Bureau of MeteorologyBoM receives information (&lt;xref linkend=&quot;b1_a_h3f7d&quot;/&gt;) about river discharges and groundwater levels, water volumes in storage, water quality in rivers and aquifers, water use and restrictions, water entitlements and water trades. The intention is that AWRIS will store and manage this data in a central database.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;To achieve this aim, AWRIS is a powerful hydroinformatic system capable of receiving, standardising, organising and interpreting water data from across the nation. The Australian Hydrological Geospatial Fabric (also known as the Geofabric refer to &lt;xref linkend=&quot;b1_ch4_s_2cgbg&quot;/&gt;) is a vital component of AWRIS. It is a specialised Geographic Information System that enables a spatial context to the data stored within AWRIS. With this spatial context, the utility of water data of the data will be enhanced through ease of access. Additionally, the Geofabric encodes the spatial connections and relationships between most of Australia’s hydrological features including rivers, dams, lakes, aquifers, diversions, supply channels, drains and monitoring points. Distribution of the data stored in AWRIS is through the BoM website and Water Online.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/section&gt;"?>

    <title>Streamflow Data</title>
    <section xml:id="b1_ch4_s_xk90m">
      <title>Introduction to Streamflow Records</title>
      <para>Streamflow data is one of the most important data requirements for individual projects
        and for development of regional procedures. As noted above, streamflow data is calculated
        from records of water levels, usually collected by major water authorities. The water levels
        are used to calculate streamflow data by the application of a stage-discharge relationship
        (rating curve) developed for the station. Continuous records of streamflow can be calculated
        from the continuous records of water levels. The stage-discharge relationship is often
        uncertain and application is one of the major sources of uncertainly in the data.</para>
      <para>As with water level data, the major water authorities have well established systems for
        storage and dissemination of their streamflow data. This data is usually available from
        these agencies, often on line, and almost always free of charge. The data dissemination
        systems are well organised and data can be supplied accurately and quickly.</para>
      <para>Different agencies around Australia maintain appropriate databases of their records.
        These systems include considerable detail on the type, accuracy and reliability of the
        gauged data including rating curve accuracy, periods of missing record, number of gaugings
        and variation in rating curves. In many cases, the system includes photos and maps of the
        station. This is valuable information and is valuable to ensure that the data is used most
        effectively. The water agencies are state based and there are differences between the
        states. Their on-line documentation should be consulted to ensure that the quality and
        limitations of the record are understood.</para>
      <para>There are few other agencies that collect streamflow data, because of the difficulties
        of calculating the flows from water levels. Where there are other sources of this data, it
        is usually limited as a part of the research project for a limited duration and locality,
        and the data is sometimes difficult to obtain. This data is also usually only for a short
        period of record, but sometimes, it may include an important event. However it is also
        possible for practitioners to calculate discharge records from water level data using
        individually developed rating curves that can be prepared from hydraulic models or other
        theoretical methods.</para>
      <para>There are many checks needed when analysing streamflow data. The principal check is on
        the accuracy and completeness of the stage-discharge relationship. This can be checked by
        assessment of the number of discharge measurements that have been taken and the maximum
        discharge (as compared to the maximum recorded water level). As well the variability in the
        stage-discharge curve indicates that the relationship has changed over time and therefore
        may be less reliable for particular events. The stage-discharge relationship may be poor for
        the lower flows because of regular changes in low flow controls. As well it may also be poor
        at higher flows because of the lack of discharge measurements at higher flows. There are
        difficulties in extrapolation of the relationships, where there is a change in conditions,
        for example where the river overtops the banks.</para>
      <para>Different gauges in the same catchment can be compared to test for consistency and the
        water balance and there is a range of other checks that can be carried out. Having more than
        one gauge in a catchment though is not particularly common.</para>
      <para>Poor quality streamflow data may mean poor quality model calibration, so a high standard
        for checks of data is important. However it is noted that it is very difficult to check the
        accuracy of the discharge records for a station, and poor quality data may be
        accepted.</para>
      <para>Streamflow records are the basic data source used in developing reliable surface water
        resources because the records provide data on the availability of streamflow and its
        variability in time and space. The records, therefore, are used in planning and design of
        surface water related projects, and are also used in management or operation of projects
        after construction of the projects is complete.</para>
      <para>In addition, streamflow records are used for calibrating catchment modelling systems
        that, for example, are used for predicting flood behaviour and for predicting hazards
        arising from design flood events. Records of flood events obtained at gauging stations also
        serve as one of the basic data sources for design flood estimation, necessary for designing
        bridges, culverts, dams and flood control reservoirs, flood plain delineation and flood
        warning systems; and in development of methods applicable to locations where data is not
        available.</para>
      <para>It is essential, to have valid records for a full range of streamflows. The streamflow
        records referred to above primarily are continuous records of discharge at stream-gauging
        stations; a gauging station being a site instrumented and operated so that a continuous
        record of stage and discharge can be obtained. A network of continuous recording gauging
        stations, however, often is augmented by auxiliary networks of partial record stations to
        fill a particular need for streamflow data at a relatively low cost. For example, an
        auxiliary network of sites, instrumented and operated to provide only instantaneous peak
        level data, is often established.</para>

        <para>Gauging stations are installed where the need for streamflow records at a site has
          been recognised. This gauging station will comprise of instruments for measuring the river
          stage and a location selected to take advantage of the best locally available conditions
          and discharge measurement and for developing a stable stage-discharge relationship,
          sometimes referred to as a rating curve. While there are instruments that simultaneously
          monitor river stage and discharge, the more common instrumentation requires the use of a
          stage-discharge relationship to convert the monitored river stage into an equivalent river
          discharge rate. Artificial controls such as low weirs or flumes are constructed at some
          stations to stabilise the stage-discharge relationships in the low discharge range. These
          control structures are calibrated by stage and discharge measurements in the field.</para>
        <para>Selection of the gauging station site and the development of the stage-discharge
          relationship are important components in the management of a gauging station and hence the
          discussion herein will focus on these aspects of management of a gauging station. While
          there are many other aspects important in management of a gauging station, these two
          aspects have the most significant impact on prediction of design flood
          characteristics.</para>
        <para>It is rare to find an ideal site for a gauging station and it is more common that the
          limitations of a site must be considered with respect to the desired data from the site.
          There are numerous guides on gauging station site selection with the aim of these guides
          on ensuring the data is reliable and criteria suggested by ISO (1995) are often adopted.
          When applying data recorded at a stream gauging station, the practitioner must review
          details of the station carefully and make an assessment of the quality and limitations of
          the record.</para>

        <title>Data Collected at a Gauging Station</title>
        <para>There are many different approaches to collection of data at a stream gauging station
          and flood investigations are not necessarily the principal objective of any particular
          gauging station. As stated previously, the purpose of a gauging station is to collect data
          about the time history of discharge at that point in the catchment drainage network. In
          general, the data collected consists of the gauge heights, sometimes referred to as
          stages. These gauge heights are used as the independent variable in a stage-discharge
          relationship to estimate the discharge at that point in time. Reliability of the discharge
          record is dependent on the accuracy and precision of the gauge-height record as well as
          the accuracy and precision of the stage-discharge relationship.</para>
        <para>Gauge-height records may be obtained by systematic observation of a non-recording
          gauge, or with automatic water level sensors and recorders. Furthermore, various types of
          transmitting systems are used to relay gauge-height information from remote gauging
          stations to storage databases.</para>
        <para>New technology, especially in the field of electronics and computer based management
          of field data, has led to a number of innovations in sensing, recording, and transmitting
          gauge height data. In the past most gauging stations used floats in stilling wells as the
          primary method of sensing gauge height and these are still in common use today. However,
          the current trend is toward the use of submersible or non-submersible pressure transducers
          which do not require a stilling well. Additionally, electronic data recorders and various
          transmission systems are being used more extensively.</para>
        <para>Details of the instruments and associated structures for a stream gauging station are
          outlined by ISO (1983), Rantz (1982), and WMO (2010) and hence are not repeated herein.
          Nonetheless, users of stream discharge data for design flood estimation should ensure that
          they are conversant with the instruments and structures employed for the collection of
          streamflow data.</para>

        <title>Stage-Discharge Relationships</title>
        <para>The conversion of a record of gauge-height to a record of discharge is through use of
          a stage-discharge relationship. The physical element or combination of elements in the
          stream channel or floodplain that maintains the relation is known as a control. One major
          classification of controls differentiates between section controls and channel controls.
          Another classification differentiates between natural and artificial controls. Artificial
          controls are structures built for the specific purpose of controlling the stage-discharge
          relation, such as a weir, flume, or small dam. A third classification differentiates
          between complete, partial and compound controls.</para>
        <para>The two attributes of a satisfactory control are stability and sensitivity. If the
          control is stable the stage-discharge relationship will be stable. If the control is
          subject to change, the stage-discharge relationship will be subject to change and frequent
          discharge measurements will be required for the continual re-calibration of the
          stage-discharge relationship. This increases the operating cost of the gauging station and
          also increases the uncertainty of streamflow records extracted from the database.
          Additional data about controls can be found in Herschy (1995).</para>
        <para>The traditional way in which a stage discharge relationship is derived for a
          particular gauging station is the measurement of discharge at convenient times.
          Traditionally, this measurement is undertaken with a current meter measuring the discharge
          velocity at enough points over the river cross section so that the discharge rate can be
          obtained for that particular stage. By taking such measurements for a number of different
          stages and corresponding discharges over a period of time, a number of points can be
          plotted on a stage-discharge diagram, and a curve drawn through those points, giving what
          is hoped to be a unique relationship between stage and discharge, the stage discharge
          relationship, as shown in <xref linkend="b1_ch4_f_tlc1u"/>. This rating curve is used in a
          manner whereby the routinely measured stages are converted to discharges by assuming that
          the corresponding discharge can be obtained from the curve.</para>

        <para>There are a number of factors which might cause the rating curve not to give the
          actual discharge, some of which will vary with time. Fenton (2001) quotes Boyer (1964) as
          describing a list of factors affecting the rating curve, or what he called a
            <emphasis>shifting control</emphasis>. These include:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>The channel and hydraulic control changing as a result of modification due to
              dredging, bridge construction, or vegetation growth;</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>Sediment transport - where the bed is in motion, which can have an effect over a
              single flood event, because the effective bed roughness can change during the event.
              As a flood increases, any bed forms present will tend to become larger and increase
              the effective roughness, so that friction is greater after the flood peak than before,
              so that the corresponding discharge for a given stage height will be less after the
              peak. This will also contribute to a flood event showing a looped curve on a stage
              discharge diagram as shown on <xref linkend="b1_ch4_f_5gqn1"/>. Both Simons and
              Richardson (1962) and Fenton and Keller (2001) have examined this phenomenon and
              presented approaches for dealing with this issue;</para>

              for the trajectory of a flood event to appear as a loop on a stage-discharge diagram

        <para>In addition to these generic problems associated with the use of rating curves, there
          are several problems associated with the use of rating curves for prediction of a design
          flood characteristic. These include:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>The assumption of a unique relationship between stage and discharge, in general,
              is not justified;</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>Discharge is rarely measured during a flood, and the quality of data at the high
              discharge end of the curve typically is quite poor because there are useually few
              velocity measurements at high flow. As a result estimation of the peak discharge of a
              flood event usually involves extrapolation of the stage-discharge relationship beyond
              the recorded data points;</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para>The relationship is usually a line of best fit through the data points defining
              the stage-discharge relationship. The approach recommended for estimation of this line
              of best fit in many guidance documents (see, for example, WMO 2010) is a visual fit.
              This approach provides minimal data on the uncertainty of the relationship and the
              reliability of any extrapolation of the relationship. This limits the estimation of
              the propagation of the uncertainty in the flood characteristic prediction approach;
              and</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>It has to describe a range of variation from no discharge through small but
              typical discharges to very large extreme flood events.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>As highlighted in the previous discussion, the unsteadiness of the discharge during a
          flood event (i.e. the variation of discharge with time) and its influence on a discharge
          estimate is ignored in the traditional application of a rating curve. In a flood event the
          slope of the water surface for a given stage will be different from that for the same
          stage during steady flow conditions; this difference will depend on whether the discharge
          is increasing or decreasing. As the flood increases, the surface slope in the river is
          greater than the slope for steady flow at the same stage, and hence, according to
          conventional hydraulic theory more water is flowing down the river than the rating curve
          would suggest. The effect of this is shown in <xref linkend="b1_ch4_f_5gqn1"/>. When the
          water level is falling, the slope and, hence, the discharge inferred is less. The effects
          might be important - the peak discharge could be significantly underestimated during
          highly dynamic floods, and also since the maximum discharge and maximum stage do not
          coincide, the arrival time of the peak discharge could be in error and may influence flood
          warning predictions. Finally, the use of a discharge hydrograph derived inaccurately by
          using a single-valued rating relationship may distort estimates for resistance
          coefficients during calibration of an unsteady flow model.</para>

          require consideration of the extrapolation methodology. The need for extrapolation is

          the highest gauging used to develop the stage-discharge relationship). All points in the

          </figure>As shown in <xref linkend="b1_ch4_f_a160s"/>, a number of the values in the

          extrapolation zone has the potential to influence fitting of the statistical model to the
          Annual Maxima Series, thereby influencing the predicted design flood quantiles. Fitting a
          statistical model to data points where the higher values are subject to estimate errors is
          discussed in <xref linkend="b3_ch2"/>.</para>
        <para>There are a number of alternative techniques for development of the extrapolation zone
          of the stage-discharge relationship, with a logarithmic extrapolation being often
          recommended. This approach however may not be applicable because in many cases, the
          extrapolation may extend from a confined channel into a floodplain.</para>
        <para>An alternative approach is the use of a hydraulic model to develop the extrapolation
          zone of the stage-discharge relationship. Similar to the application of a logarithmic
          technique, the suitability of this approach needs to be confirmed prior to its
          application. Of particular concern is the modelling of the energy losses associated with
          flow in the channel and adjacent floodplains where it is necessary to assume that the
          parameter values obtained during calibration are suitable for the larger discharges being
          simulated in the extrapolation zone of the stage-discharge relationship.</para>
        <para>The important point in this discussion, however, is a recognition that the values of
          the data extracted from a discharge record for fitting of a statistical model will contain
          values where the conversion of the recorded level to an equivalent discharge occurred
          through extrapolation of the stage-discharge relationship. Consideration of this in the
          fitting of a statistical model to the Annual Maxima Series is discussed later in <xref

        <title>Uncertainty of Discharge Measurements</title>
        <para>The accuracy, or uncertainty, of a discharge measurement is very important for
          purposes of assessing the quality and reliability of that measurement. The concept of
          error and error analysis is a long-standing practice in the field of hydraulics and
          hydrology. The concept of uncertainty, however, is relatively new. Nonetheless, methods
          for evaluating, defining and expressing the uncertainty of streamflow measurements have
          developed.</para>
        <para>Uncertainty and accuracy are terms that are sometimes used interchangeably even though
          they have two very distinct meanings. Accuracy (or error) refers to the agreement, or
          disagreement, between the measurement of stream discharge and the true or correct value of
          the discharge at the time of measurement. Since we can never know the true value of the
          discharge, we can never know the exact amount of error in the discharge
          measurement.</para>
        <para>The uncertainty of a discharge measurement, on the other hand, acknowledges that no
          measurement is perfect. It is defined, therefore, as a parameter associated with the
          result of a measurement that characterises the dispersion of values that could reasonably
          be attributed to the measurement. It is typically expressed as a range of values in which
          the measurement value is estimated to lie, within a given statistical confidence. It does
          not attempt to define or rely on a unique true value. To summarise, common usage of the
          word 'accuracy' for quantitatively describing the characteristics of a discharge
          measurement is incompatible with its correct meaning. The proper term for expressing the
          statistical confidence of possible values for a discharge measurement is
          uncertainty.</para>
        <para>The sources of uncertainty in discharge mesaurements can be categorised as:</para>

Ideally, cross-sections are provided at break-out points to the floodplain and at all locations where there is a significant change in channel characteristics, such as conveyance. Additionally, it is worthwhile to include survey breaklines along the tops of the banks to provide an additional aid for the hydraulic modelling of overbank breakouts during design (or historical) flood events.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;It is also worth noting that field practicalities such as bank vegetation, access to the channel and water depth may influence the actual location of the cross-sections surveyed.&lt;/para&gt;"?>

          <para>Often these structures constrict and obstruct flood discharges thereby influencing
            the design flood estimation. The effects on flood behaviour may be intentional (such as
            a weir) or unintentional (such as blockage at a culvert). Where the effect on flood
            discharge is unintentional, it is worth noting that the effect may be stochastic and
            hence the likelihood of the effect needs to be considered by a suitable joint
            probability technique. Irrespective of whether the influence is intentional or

            conditions as part of an operational flood management strategy. Hence, the impact of

          <para>The purpose of a levee is to divert discharges as part of an operational flood

            magnitude of a flood event; in other words, there is a defined probability that a levee
            can be overtopped (with or without failure of the levee bank) by a flood rarer than the
            levee was designed to protect against. Hence, in design flood estimation, the geometric
            properties of a levee are important to enable suitable estimation of the flood

            control points can be used to give these relative positions absolute values. More
            sophisticated algorithms can exploit other information on the scene known as

            Typically, the accuracy requested when scoping photogrammetric data collection for flood

            photographs, the photogrammetrist is sometimes able to pick the odd ground surface

          <para>The vertical and horizontal accuracy of ground surface level measurement by ALS is a
            function of the laser specification, flying height, ground control and the surface
            coverage. Hard road surfaces, for example, normally are able to be measured accurately,
            but other surface types (for example, swamps or heavily vegetated areas) are not easy to
            measure and hence the measurements must be treated with caution. It is useful to note
            that many quoted accuracy values for ALS data are in reference to the data accuracy for
            clear hard ground. For clear, hard ground (that is ground with no surface coverage), the

            </table>A disadvantage of the ALS data capture method (compared to, for example,
            low-level photogrammetry) is the absence of breaklines in the data to define distinct,
            continuous topographic features and significant changes in grade. While the horizontal
            density of points usually is quite high ( average point spacing of 1 to 2 metres
            depending on flying height and sampling frequency), features such as narrow banks/levees
            or channels will only be resolved if the data are sampled on a very small grid (less
            than 1 to 2m grid). This can result in large and unwieldy terrain files.</para>

            approaches (2), (3) and (4). While approach (4) nominally provides the widest coverage
            and extracts the most information from the ALS data, the processes cannot be considered
            reliable as no method has been developed for testing the validity of the breaklines
            produced.</para>
          <para>Although requiring a greater manual input, it is considered that approaches (2) and
            (3) are better approaches for the provision of reliable estimates of the surface level
            at critical locations with in the floodplain. This arises from the manual checking that
            occurs during the progress of approaches (2) and (3). Furthermore, long-sections from

                height is representative of an area defined by the grid dimensions. This grid has
                been created by "thinning" the raw ALS point cloud dataset. While the dimensions of
                the grid are defined by the user, it is useful to note that the smaller the grid,
                the larger and perhaps more unwieldy the dataset being used but the surface
                topography will have an apparent higher definition. Conversely, the larger the grid,
                the smaller the dataset but the surface topography will have an apparent lower
                definition. It is also worth noting that definition of the surface topography only
                needs to be adequate to provide the necessary information and that any additional
                definition will not provide either additional flood data or accuracy of the
                predicted flood data.</para>

            <listitem>
              <para>There are no breaklines in the model of the surface topography. Breaklines can
                be created according to the approaches discussed previously but typically are not
                determined solely from the ALS data.</para>

                due to, for example, heavy vegetation or surface water. These areas can be removed
                during the processing as "non-ground" points. When using a processed ALS dataset,
                there will be situations where a non-ground elevation point (for example, a point
                that has hit the canopy of trees) has not been removed during processing. As a
                result, the spot elevation remains in the dataset and would be treated as a surface
                elevation. In some situations. Errors of this type are obvious and can be removed
                manually. In other situations, they may not be obvious and hence will form part of
                the DEM (Digital Elevation Model) used in the analysis. Users need to be cognisant
                of errors of this type in ALS data and the consequent significant impacts on the
                predictions obtained from the catchment modelling system.</para>

          <para>As discussed in <xref linkend="b1_ch4_s_lyk4o"/>, survey data is not exact and will
            have a tolerance or a stated level of accuracy. Data obtained from aerial survey is the
            same. With data obtained from aerial survey, accuracy is dependent upon a number of
            factors, including flying height and the number of control points. In general, the
            required accuracy is advised prior to commencement of data collection and the surveyor
            designs the data collection program needed to achieve the desired accuracy.</para>
          <para>An important point to note is that the accuracy of the collected data is checked and
            confirmed. The resultant stated accuracy typically does not apply to the DTM derived

                phase. Alternatively, early liaison with the aerial surveyor may allow the location

                DTM SURFACE: A more appropriate approach may be to field survey a number of
                breakline strings along key linear features. These strings may be some 50 m - 200 m
                in length with points at regular spacing (say every 5 -15 m). A comparison can then
                be made of the profiles along the feature determined from both the aerial and field
                survey. In addition, if the strings are across conveyance paths (i.e. they are
                cross-sections), the modeller can check that conveyance cross-sectional areas are
                adequately represented. These comparisons enable a qualitative assessment of aerial
                survey accuracy for a given region within the study area. A number of surveyed
                strings may be required across the study area to gain an overall appreciation of
                accuracy.</para>

          in longitude and latitude is approximately 30m) to 9 seconds (9 seconds in longitude and
          latitude is approximately 250 metres). As development of these databases occur, it is
          likely that these specifications will change. Therefore, as with other sources of data,
          users should ensure that they use the most appropriate data for their problem.</para>

        <title>Aerial Photographs</title>
        <para>Aerial photographs are an important source of qualitative data and can be collected
          during an aerial survey. Geo-referenced (or ortho-rectified) aerial photos can be supplied
          as part of a photogrammetric survey. These geo-referenced aerial photographs are aerial
          photos where spatial coordinates have been added to locate the photograph. It is important
          to recognise that the raw aerial photograph is spatially distorted, being a planar image
          of a curved surface of variable height. In ortho-rectifying the image, the image is
          scaled, rotated and stretched so that various reference locations move to their correct
          coordinate locations.</para>
        <para>A consequence of this is the location of features on an aerial photograph will have a
          degree of uncertainty. For example, if a rectified aerial photograph is used to locate a
          flood mark, the attributed location will be subject to a tolerance. In an area of high
          flood gradient this can result in differences between observed and simulated flood levels
          that do not accurately represent the true differences.</para>
        <para>Aerial photographs, while not providing quantitative data directly, can provide
          additional information about flowpaths, flow obstacles and floodplain vegetation that is
          not always immediately evident or accessible on a site inspection. Additionally, aerial
          photos can be a useful guide when defining parameters for floodplain characteristics (for
          example, roughness coefficients) and can be used to develop a spatial map of the
          floodplain parameter.</para>
        <para>Another example of the use of aerial photography is its use in urban areas to define
          building outlines or fence lines where these are to be included within the hydraulic model
          and can be a reasonable source of information for assessing the total imperviousness of a
          catchment (see <xref linkend="b5_ch4"/>).</para>
        <para>Finally, when historical aerial photography is available, it is useful in assessing
          catchment development or sourcing information on the floodplain development when
          historical events occurred.</para>

        <title>Historical Topography and Infrastructure</title>
        <para>All data collection methods covered thus far have been concerned with present day
          catchment conditions. However, when catchment modelling systems are used for design flood
          estimation, calibration to historical events is required and the catchment and floodplain
          conditions at the time of the historical event need to be considered particularly as these
          conditions may not be the same as present day conditions. In addition, if a number of
          events are to be used during the calibration process, changes to catchment conditions may
          occur between events.</para>
        <para>Conditions at each of the relevant historical points in time must be established and
          used in the model development; this is discussed in more detail in <xref linkend="book7"
          />. Changes to conditions that may affect flood behaviour include dam construction,
          initial dam storage levels, dredging or siltation of river channels and particularly of
          river mouths, construction of levees and other associated flood mitigation works, road
          construction including the raising or duplication of roads, the realignment of road
          embankments, the construction of new culverts and/or bridges, upgraded drainage networks
          both in rural and urban environments, developments on the floodplain, the construction of
          new weirs or the removal of old weirs, different crop types or stage in the growing
          season, and others that have not been mentioned here. Depending upon the length of time
          since the occurrence of the calibration event, record of these changes may be only
          available anecdotally.</para>
        <para>The availability of data for historical events needs to be considered when the event
          is used as part of the design flood estimation. For example, there may be anecdotal or
          even good formal measurement evidence of a record flood that occurred 100 years ago but
          details of this flood event may not be adequate for its use as a calibration event for
          validation of a catchment modelling system. On the other hand, the data may be adequate
          for it to be included as a high discharge censored event in a flood frequency analysis

        <title>Soil Data</title>
        <para>Some hydrologic models require information on the catchment soil properties (for
          example, information on the A and B horizon depths and their water holding capacity, or
          the soil type) to estimate losses from the rainfall.</para>
        <para>Soil property data is available spatially for the whole country from the Atlas of
          Australian Soils (Mckenzie et al., 2000); this information is available in a GIS format
          from the Australian Soil Resource Information System website. These maps are broad scale
          (typically 1:250000 - 1:500000) and were completed between 1960 and 1968. State based maps
          are available, also. Care should be taken when using soil maps as variations in soil over
          short distances occur frequently and cannot be resolved by the reconnaissance style
          mapping used in their development (Mckenzie et al., 2000).</para>
        <para>While it is possible to estimate land subject to inundation by floods through
          consideration of the soils and geomorphology, this does not provide any guidance on the

          need to ensure that the soil and geomorphoric data is obtained at a fine scale to ensure

There is confidence that these changes in the hydrological cycle will lead to increased variability in precipitation and increased frequency of flood events over many areas (IPCC 2007, Bates et al. 2008). Changes in climate will result in changes in the frequency, intensity, spatial extent, duration, and timing of extreme weather and climate events, and may lead to unprecedented extreme weather and climate events (IPCC, 2012).&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The major areas where climate change will impact flooding are:&lt;/para&gt;&lt;itemizedlist&gt;&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;Design rainfall intensity-frequency-duration;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;Storm type, frequency, and depth;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;Rainfall spatial and temporal patterns;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;Antecedent conditions;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;Changes in sea level and;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;The joint probability of storm surge and flood producing rainfall.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;&lt;/itemizedlist&gt;&lt;section&gt;&lt;title&gt;Climate Change Impacts on Rainfall&lt;/title&gt;&lt;para&gt;Changes in extremes events, such as floods, can be linked to changes in the mean, variance, or shape of probability distributions, or all of these (IPCC, 2012). For example, climate change projections have shown that a relatively small shift in the distribution of precipitation may result in a large change in the frequency and magnitude of extreme precipitation events (Nicholls and Alexander, 2007). Studies have shown that a change in the shape of the distribution of precipitation is likely to have a greater effect on the frequency of extremes than a shift in the mean precipitation (White, 2010; Groisman et al. 1999), and that climate change is most likely to increase climate variability, particularly affecting the extremes (Jones et al., 2012; Fowler and Ekstrom, 2009).&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A warming climate leads to an increase in the water holding capacity of the air, which causes an increase in the atmospheric water vapour that supplies storms, resulting in more intense precipitation. This effect is observed, even in areas where total precipitation is decreasing (Trenberth, 2011). Indeed, some of the largest impacts of climate change are likely to result from a shift in the frequency and strength of climatic extremes, including precipitation (White et al., 2010). It is likely that the frequency of heavy precipitation will increase by the end of the 21st century, particularly in the high latitudes and tropical regions and there is likely to be an increase in heavy rainfalls associated with tropical cyclones (IPCC, 2012).&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;There have been many studies globally that have found increases in the intensity or frequency of extreme precipitation events (Bates et al., 2008; Westra et al., 2013). It is likely that since the 1970s the frequency of heavy precipitation events has increased over most areas (Bates, et al. 2008). From 1950 to 2005, extreme daily rainfall intensity and frequency has increased in north-western and central Australia and over the western tablelands of New South Wales, but decreased in the south-east and south-west and along the central east coast (CSIRO, 2007). Projections analysed by CSIRO (2007) showed that an increase in daily precipitation intensity is likely under climate change. The study found that the highest 1% of daily rainfalls tends to increase in the north of Australia and decrease in the south, with widespread increases in summer and autumn, but not in the south in winter and spring when there is a strong decrease in mean precipitation (CSIRO 2007).&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The increases in precipitation are more evident in sub-daily rainfalls and major changes in the intensity and temporal patterns of sub-daily rainfalls can be expected by the end of the 21st century (Westra et al., 2013). In a study of downscaled outputs from climate models, Abbs and Rafter (2008) found that by 2070 the models projected an increase of an average of 40% in intensity for 24 and 72 hour events around the Queensland-New South Wales border, and an increase of more than 70% in the two hour rainfall events in the high terrain inland from the Gold Coast.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section&gt;&lt;title&gt;Antecedent Conditions&lt;/title&gt;&lt;para&gt;Changes in the patterns of precipitation and in evaporation will lead to changes in antecedent conditions to flood events, affecting soil moisture and thus loss rates in the catchment (Bates et. al., 2008). Potential evaporation is projected to increase almost everywhere on a global scale due to an increase in the water-holding capacity of the atmosphere with higher temperatures combined with little projected change in relative humidity (Bates et al. 2008).&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Projections of potential evapotranspiration over Australia show increases by 2030 and 2070. The largest projected increases are in the north and east, where the change by 2030 ranges from little change to a 6% increase, with the best estimate being a 2% increase. By 2070, the A1FI scenario gives increases of 2% to 10% in the south and west with a best estimate of around 6%, and a range of 6% to 16% in the north and east with a best estimate around 10%. (CSIRO, 2007).&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Projected decreases in rainfall over much of Australia combined with increases in evaporation may result in disproportionate decreases in runoff due to a disconnection between surface and groundwater, as was experienced in parts of Australia during the Millenium drought (CSIRO, 2012).&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section&gt;&lt;title&gt;Sea Level&lt;/title&gt;&lt;para&gt;The relatively small rise in sea level that is seen in observed data over the past century has already caused a significant change in the frequency of extreme sea-level events, and associated flooding (Hunter, 2007). Studies of observed sea level data worldwide have shown that sea-level rise is the predominant cause of increases in the frequency of extreme sea-level events (IPCC, 2007; Hunter, 2007). There is high confidence that there has been an increase in the frequency of high coastal sea-level events of a given magnitude, and that extreme flooding events due to sea level rise will increase significantly, dependent on location (Church et al. 2012). The likely range of global-mean sea-level rise between the 1980 – 1999 and 2090 – 2099 periods is given by IPCC (2007) as 0.18 – 0.59 m. There is high confidence that the global rate of sea level rise has increased between the mid-19th and the mid-20th centuries. The average rate was 1.7 ± 0.5 mm/yr for the 20th century and 3.1 ± 0.7 mm/yr for 1993–2003 (Bates et al., 2008). The observed rate of sea-level rise in the Australian region from 1993 - 2011 has high spatial variability, with a maximum in the north and north-west coasts of Australia of 9mm/yr, and a rate of 2 to 4 mm/yr on the south-eastern and eastern Australian coastline (Church et al., 2012).&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/section&gt;"?>

      <para>Observed data is often used to investigate whether there are any trends apparent in
        historical flood data. The data used to project the impacts of future climate on flooding is
        generally sourced from climate modelling. “Any useful technique for the assessment of future
        risk should combine our knowledge of the present, our best estimate of how the world will
        change, and the uncertainty in both”. (Hunter, 2007). To study the impact of climate change,
        a plausible and consistent description of a possible future climate is required. The
        construction of such climate change scenarios relies mainly on results from model
        projections, although some information from past climates can be used (IPCC,
        2001).<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_insert_start author="retallick" timestamp="20151127T145506+1100"?>

        <title>Observed Data</title>
        <para>Stationarity is one of the fundamental assumptions in traditional design flood
          estimation. Climate change challenges this assumption as observed historical rainfall and
          flow data may not be a good indicator of future conditions. This has implications for the
          use of historical data in assessment of flood risk including in estimation of design
          rainfalls, flood frequency analysis, sea-level and storm surge, and estimates of design
          flood model parameters that account for losses.</para>
        <para>Detecting changes in the frequency or intensity of precipitation or flood events in
          recorded data presents a number of difficulties (Jones et. al., 2012; Milly et al., 2008).
          The ability to assess climate-driven observed changes in the magnitude and frequency of
          floods at regional scales is limited by the lack of observed records and their coverage in
          space and time, and by changes in catchments due to land-use and development (IPCC, 2012).
          Attributing trends in discharge data to climate change is particularly difficult, as
          changes in catchment conditions, or river operations can contribute to trends in the data
          (Bates et al., 2008). Long-term records are needed to be able to detect trends in data,
          and the availability of consistent, quality controlled data is a major limitation in any
          study to detect trends in large to extreme rainfall or flood data (Bates et al., 2008).
          There is evidence that climate change will result in a larger increase in extreme
          sub-daily rainfalls than at a longer duration (Westra, 2011). The availability of long
          records of sub-daily rainfall data is limited, with an average length of Australian
          sub-daily rainfall stations of approximately 19 years compared to an average length of 65
          years for daily rainfall stations (Johnson et. al., 2012).</para>
        <para>One of the most fundamental issues in detecting trends in precipitation or discharge
          data due to climate change is separating the influences of climate variability from
          long-term climate change in a relatively short record. Due to the normal range of climate
          variability, there is limited information available to establish the probability of a
          flood event currently, even without consideration of climate change (White et al., 2010).
          Local and regional changes in precipitation due to climate change are greatly affected by
          patterns of atmospheric circulation. Patterns of change in precipitation associated with
          ENSO can dominate the global patterns of variations, particularly in the tropics and over
          much of the mid-latitudes (Trenberth, 2011). There is little observed data available to
          investigate relationships between hemispheric scale modes of the atmosphere (such as ENSO)
          and climate change.</para>
        <para>The observed data available to directly estimate the impacts of climate change on
          antecedent conditions includes seasonal rainfalls, evapotranspiration, and soil moisture.
          Detecting changes in these parameters can be undertaken with a trend analysis, however
          long records with appropriate spatial coverage are required for this task. As for
          detecting changes in extreme precipitation or discharge events, the difficulty is in
          separating the impacts of climate change from natural variability or the influence of
          changes in catchment conditions, in the relatively short records available. The coverage
          of directly measured evapotranspiration data is relatively sparse across Australia and is
          very limited globally (Bates et al., 2008). Evapotranspiration data available from global
          analysis data is sensitive to the type of analysis and the uncertainty in the data makes
          it unsuitable for trend analysis (Bates et al. 2008). Direct measurements of soil moisture
          are available for only a few regions and are often very short in duration (Bates et al.,
          2008).</para>

          extreme sea levels, however a reliable analysis of the risk of extreme events or trends in
          the data is limited by the short duration of records collected at many gauges. Church
          et.al. (2006) found only two gauges of sufficient length for use in this type of analysis
          in Australia, and only nineteen records with lengths of 40 years or greater (and some of
          these were intermittent). The limited number of tide gauges means that there is no data
          available for large stretches of coastline, which inhibits the assessment of this hazard
          even under present climate conditions, let alone future conditions due to climate change
          (McInnes et al., 2007).</para>

          Climate Models (GCMs) are most often used to generate data to investigate the impacts of
          climate change into the future on a global or continental scale.</para>
        <para>Climate models are mathematical representations of the climate system, expressed as
          computer codes and run on computers (IPCC, 2007). The models would be too complex to run
          on any existing computer if all variables in the climate system were explicitly included
          in the models, so simplifications are made so that the system has reduced complexity and
          computing requirements (IPCC, 2001). Outputs from GCMs cover many variables that impact
          the hydrologic cycle including precipitation, evaporation, soil moisture and sea level.
          GCMs have been developed by a range of international agencies. The Intergovernmental Panel
          on Climate Change’s (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (2007) used climate modelling output
          from 23 different GCMs as the basis of their global assessment of climate change (IPCC,
          2007). GCMs differ in their representations of climatology and thus using an ensemble
          including a range of GCMs can enhance the representation of specific weather patterns
          (Abbs and Rafter, 2009; Grose 2011).</para>
        <para>In order to address the uncertainty in future greenhouse gas emissions, a range of
          plausible futures are often run with the GCMs. IPCC (2007) developed a range of emissions
          scenarios (SRES emissions scenarios) that are commonly used with GCMs. The SRES emissions
          scenarios are divided into six families based on different likely emissions considering
          future technological and societal changes (Corney et. al., 2010).

        <para>Areas of uncertainty in the GCM projections include uncertainty in future levels of
          greenhouse gas emissions, the response of the climate to the emissions, and changes in
          regional climate (CSIRO, 2012). The cascade of uncertainties in projections is shown in
          Figure 2. The uncertainty in the levels of emissions results from a lack of knowledge of
          the future social, economic and technological development of the world, and the associated
          greenhouse-gas emissions. The model uncertainty is due to deficiencies in the knowledge of
          the science of climate change, in setting initial conditions for the models, and in the
          representation of the global climate by the models (Hunter, 2007). There are also
          deficiencies in the simulation of tropical precipitation, the El Niño- Southern
          Oscillation and the Madden-Julian Oscillation. Most of these errors are due to the fact
          that many important small-scale processes cannot be represented explicitly in GCMs, and so
          must be included in approximate form as they interact with larger-scale features. This is
          partly due to limitations in computing power, but also results from limitations in
          scientific understanding or in the availability of detailed observations of some physical
          processes (IPCC, 2007).</para>

          scale required to investigate the factors influencing flood events (Corney et.al. 2010).
          Some form of downscaling is required to investigate the impacts of future climate on
          specific variables at a local scale, in particular for precipitation and climate extremes.
          To address the decrease in confidence in the changes projected by global models at smaller
          scales, other techniques, including the use of regional climate models and downscaling
          methods, have been specifically developed for the study of local-scale climate change
          (IPCC, 2007). Three methods are commonly used to scale outputs from GCMs: temperature
          scaling, statistical downscaling, and dynamical downscaling (Westra, 2011). Combinations
          of these methods are also used.</para>

        <para>Temperature scaling has been used give downscaled estimates of precipitation from
          GCMs. Extreme precipitation is directly related to the water holding capacity of the
          atmosphere. A warming climate leads to an increase in the water holding capacity of the
          air, which causes an increase in the atmospheric water vapour that supplies storms,
          resulting in more intense precipitation (Trenberth, 2011). The Casius-Clayperon
          relationship gives an increase of water holding capacity of approximately 7% per degree
          Celsius of warming (Trenberth, 2011). This relationship has been found to hold for some
          sub-daily rainfalls, however daily extreme rainfalls have been found increase at a lower
          rate (Lenderink and van Meijgaard, 2008). The relationship also appears to hold only to a
          threshold temperature (Hardwick-Jones, 2010). The simple scaling of rainfall with
          temperature does not reflect all the processes that produce rainfall events. The true
          scaling relationship is more complex and is affected by the extremity and duration of the
          rainfall event, the atmospheric temperature, and access to atmospheric moisture (Westra et
          al., 2013). This results in differing local impacts of climate change and, in particular,
          different impacts are seen dependent on the duration of the rainfall event.</para>

        <para>Statistical downscaling uses relationships between large-scale climate variables and
          local scale weather to develop estimates at a local scale. In the simulation of extreme
          rainfalls, a common approach is to use extreme value distributions to describe
          precipitation extremes (Abbs and Rafter, 2009). Another approach is to use a model to
          simulate precipitation and to then analyse the extremes (Mehrota and Sharma, 2010). The
          advantage of statistical downscaling is that it is not computationally intense, and can be
          undertaken relatively quickly over large areas. The limitations of statistical downscaling

          focuses on a small area, it can provide more detail over that area than is possible with a
          GCM alone (Grose et. al, 2010). Dynamical downscaling allows representation of local scale
          features, such as orographic effects, land-sea contrast and other land surface
          characteristics, and smaller scale physical processes that influence extreme precipitation
          (Maraun et. al. 2010). By modelling the atmosphere and local environment at a much finer
          scale than is possible using a GCM, it is expected that the specific processes that drive
          regional weather and climate will be better represented. Bias corrected outputs from
          dynamically downscaled models have been shown to be able to be used directly in
          projections of changes in extreme precipitation (White et al., 2010). A number of studies
          have used RCMs to investigate changes to daily precipitation extremes, however a lack of
          available sub-daily RCM data has limited studies on shorter<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="retallick" timestamp="20151127T073111+1100" content="-"?><?oxy_insert_start author="retallick" timestamp="20151127T073112+1100"?>

          events (Hanel and Buishand, 2010). The advantages of dynamical downscaling are in the
          ability to represent changes in rainfall spatial and temporal patterns, as well as impacts
          of local scale features. The disadvantage of dynamical downscaling is in computational
          time. There are assumptions inherent in the structure of each RCM and ideally a range of
          RCMs would be used in conjunction with a range of GCMs to give a more comprehensive
          description of local climate. The ability to undertake such studies is inhibited by the
          computational intensity of the task, and thus studies are generally limited to use of one
          or two RCMs with a range of GCMs.</para>

The records, therefore, are used in the planning and design of surface water related projects, and are also they are used in the management or operation of the projects after construction of the projects has been is completed.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In addition, streamflow records are used for calibrating catchment modelling systems whichthat, for example, are used for predicting flood behaviour and for predicting hazards arising from design flood events. Records of flood events obtained at gauging stations also serve as one of the basic data sources for design flood estimation, necessary for the designing of bridges, culverts, dams and flood control reservoirs, flood plain delineation and flood warning systems; and in the development of methods applicable to locations where data is not available.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;It is essential, to have valid records for a full range of streamflows. The streamflow records referred to above primarily are continuous records of discharge at stream-gauging stations; a gauging station being a site instrumented and operated so that a continuous record of stage and discharge can be obtained. A network of continuous recording gauging stations, however, often is augmented by auxiliary networks of partial record stations to fill a particular need for streamflow data at a relatively low cost. For example, an auxiliary network of sites, instrumented and operated to provide only instantaneous peak level data, is often established.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section xml:id=&quot;b1_ch4_s_ptlni&quot;&gt;&lt;title&gt;General Stream Gauging Procedures&lt;/title&gt;&lt;section xml:id=&quot;b1_ch4_s_3ufed&quot;&gt;&lt;title&gt;Introduction&lt;/title&gt;&lt;para&gt;When a need for streamflow records at a site is will be recognised, a gauging station will be installed. This gauging station will comprise of instruments for the measuringe of the river stage and a location selected to take advantage of the best locally available conditions for stage and discharge measurement and for developing a stable stage-discharge relationship, sometimes referred to as a rating curve. While there are instruments available that simultaneously monitor river stage and discharge, the more common instrumentation requires the use of a stage-discharge relationship to convert the monitored river stage into an equivalent river discharge rate. Artificial controls such as low weirs or flumes are constructed at some stations to stabilisze the stage-discharge relationships in the low discharge range. These control structures are calibrated by stage and discharge measurements in the field.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Selection of the gauging station site and the development of the stage-discharge relationship are important components in the management of a gauging station and hence the discussion herein will focus on these aspects of management of a gauging station. While there are many other aspects important in the management of a gauging station, these two aspects have the most significant impact on prediction of design flood characteristics.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section xml:id=&quot;b1_ch4_s_18vxf&quot;&gt;&lt;title&gt;Selection of Gauging Station Sites&lt;/title&gt;&lt;para&gt;After the need for a gauging station has been recognised, there is a need to determine a location for the gauging station. There are numerous guides on site selection with the aim of these guides on ensuring the data is reliable. Criteria suggested by ISO (1995) for an ideal gauging station site are:&lt;/para&gt;&lt;itemizedlist&gt;&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;The general course of the stream is straight for about 10 times the stream width, upstream and downstream from the gauging station site if the control is a river reach (channel control). If the control is a section control, the downstream conditions must be such that the control is not drowned. The water entering a section control should have low velocity;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;The total discharge is confined to one channel at all stages and no discharge bypasses the site as subsurface flow or in anabranches activated during flood events. Where flood discharges by-pass the site of the gauging station and no alternative site exists, consideration should be given to gauging the by-pass routes;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;The stream-bed is not subject to scour and fill and is relatively free of aquatic vegetation;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;Banks are permanent, high enough to contain floods, and are free of brush;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;A pool is present upstream from the control at extremely low stages to ensure a recording of stage at extremely low discharge, and to avoid high velocities at the stream end of stage recorder intakes, transducers, or manometer orifice during periods of high discharge. The sensitivity of the control should be such that any significant change in discharge shall result in a measurable change in stage. Also, the pool volume should not be a significant proportion of the flood hydrograph volume thereby limiting the attenuation effects of the gauging station. This point is very important for the gauging of urban catchments which tend to be small and fast responding;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;The gauging station site is far enough upstream from the confluence with another stream or from tidal effect to avoid any variable influence the other stream or the tide may have on the stage at the gauging station site;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;The site is readily accessible for ease in installation and operation of the gauging station;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;Good conditions for discharge measurements at all stages;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;Instruments, shelter, and housing are above all flood levels. Additionally, the sensors used have a suitable range to measure both high and low discharge conditions.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;&lt;/itemizedlist&gt;&lt;para&gt;However, it is rare to find the ideal site for a gauging station. It is more common that the limitations of a site must be considered with respect to the desired data from the site.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section xml:id=&quot;b1_ch4_s_yw6bd&quot;&gt;&lt;title&gt;Data Collected at a Gauging Station&lt;/title&gt;&lt;para&gt;There are many different approaches to collection of data at a stream gauging station. As stated previously, the purpose of a gauging station is to collect data about the time history of discharge at that point in the catchment drainage network. In general, the data collected consists of the gauge heights, sometimes referred to as stages. These gauge heights are used as the independent variable in a stage-discharge relationship to estimate the discharge at that point in time. Reliability of the discharge record is dependent on the accuracy and precision of the gauge-height record as well as the accuracy and precision of the stage-discharge relationship.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Gauge-height records may be obtained by systematic observation of a non-recording gauge, or with automatic water level sensors and recorders. Furthermore, various types of transmitting systems are used to relay gauge-height information from remote gauging stations to storage databases.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;New technology, especially in the field of electronics and computer based management of field data, has led to a number of innovations in sensing, recording, and transmitting gauge height data. In the past the majority of gauging stations used floats in stilling wells as the primary method of sensing gauge height. Floats and stilling wells are still in common use today. However, the current trend is toward the use of submersible or non-submersible pressure transducers which do not require a stilling well. Additionally, electronic data recorders and various transmission systems are being used more extensively.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Details of the instruments and associated structures for a stream gauging station are outlined by ISO (1983), Rantz (1982), and WMO (2010) and hence are not repeated herein. Nonetheless, users of stream discharge data for design flood estimation should ensure that they are conversant with the instruments and structures employed for the collection of streamflow data.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section xml:id=&quot;b1_ch4_s_id9c8&quot;&gt;&lt;title&gt;Stage-Discharge Relationships&lt;/title&gt;&lt;para&gt;The conversion of a record of gauge-height to a record of discharge is through use of a stage-discharge relationship. The physical element or combination of elements that maintains the relation is known as a control. One major classification of controls differentiates between section controls and channel controls. Another classification differentiates between natural and artificial controls. Artificial controls are structures built for the specific purpose of controlling the stage-discharge relation, such as a weir, flume, or small dam. A third classification differentiates between complete, partial and compound controls.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The two attributes of a satisfactory control are stability and sensitivity. If the control is stable the stage-discharge relationship will be stable. If the control is subject to change, the stage-discharge relationship will be subject to change and frequent discharge measurements will be required for the continual re-calibration of the stage-discharge relationship. This increases the operating cost of the gauging station and also increases the uncertainty of streamflow records extracted from the database. Additional data about controls can be found in Herschy (1995).&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The traditional way in which a stage discharge relationship is derived for a particular gauging station is the measurement of discharge at convenient times. Traditionally, this measurement is undertaken with a current meter measuring the discharge velocity at enough points over the river cross section so that the discharge rate can be obtained for that particular stage. By taking such measurements for a number of different stages and corresponding discharges over a period of time, a number of points can be plotted on a stage-discharge diagram, and a curve drawn through those points, giving what is hoped to be a unique relationship between stage and discharge, the stage discharge relationship, as shown in &lt;xref linkend=&quot;b1_ch4_f_tlc1u&quot;/&gt;. This rating curve is used in a manner whereby the routinely measured stages are converted to discharges by assuming that the corresponding discharge can be obtained from the curve.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;figure xml:id=&quot;b1_ch4_f_tlc1u&quot;&gt;&lt;title&gt;Typical Rating Curve&lt;/title&gt;&lt;mediaobject&gt;&lt;imageobject&gt;&lt;imagedata contentdepth=&quot;60%&quot; fileref=&quot;../../figures/1012.jpg&quot; scalefit=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;/imageobject&gt;&lt;/mediaobject&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;para&gt;There are a number of factors which might cause the rating curve not to give the actual discharge, some of which will vary with time. Fenton (2001) quotes Boyer (1964) as describing a list of factors affecting the rating curve, or what he called a &lt;emphasis&gt;shifting control&lt;/emphasis&gt;. These include:&lt;/para&gt;&lt;itemizedlist&gt;&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;The channel changing as a result of modification due to dredging, bridge construction, or vegetation growth;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;Sediment transport - where the bed is in motion, which can have an effect over a single flood event, because the effective bed roughness can change during the event. As a flood increases, any bed forms present will tend to become larger and increase the effective roughness, so that friction is greater after the flood peak than before, so that the corresponding discharge for a given stage height will be less after the peak. This will also contribute to a flood event showing a looped curve on a stage discharge diagram as shown on &lt;xref linkend=&quot;b1_ch4_f_5gqn1&quot;/&gt;. Both Simons and Richardson (1962) and Fenton and Keller (2001) have examined this phenomenon and presented approaches for dealing with this issue;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;Backwater effects - changes in the conditions downstream such as the construction of a dam or flooding in the next waterway downstream;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;Unsteadiness - in general the discharge will change rapidly during a flood, and the slope of the water surface will be different from that for a constant stage, depending on whether the discharge is increasing or decreasing. The effect of this is for the trajectory of a flood event to appear as a loop on a stage-discharge diagram as shown in &lt;xref linkend=&quot;b1_ch4_f_5gqn1&quot;/&gt;;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;Variable channel storage - where the stream overflows onto floodplains during high discharges, giving rise to different slopes and to unsteadiness effects; and&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;Vegetation - changing the roughness and hence changing the stage-discharge relationship.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;&lt;/itemizedlist&gt;&lt;figure xml:id=&quot;b1_ch4_f_5gqn1&quot;&gt;&lt;title&gt;Loop in Rating Curve&lt;/title&gt;&lt;mediaobject&gt;&lt;imageobject&gt;&lt;imagedata contentdepth=&quot;60%&quot; fileref=&quot;../../figures/1002.jpg&quot; scalefit=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;/imageobject&gt;&lt;/mediaobject&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;para&gt;In addition to these generic problems associated with the use of rating curves, there are several problems associated with the use of rating curves for prediction of a design flood characteristic. These include:&lt;/para&gt;&lt;itemizedlist&gt;&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;The assumption of a unique relationship between stage and discharge, in general, is not justified;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;Discharge is rarely measured during a flood, and the quality of data at the high discharge end of the curve typically is quite poor. As a result estimation of the peak discharge of a flood event usually involves extrapolation of the stage-discharge relationship beyond the recorded data points;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;The relationship is usually a line of best fit through the data points defining the stage-discharge relationship. The approach recommended for estimation of this line of best fit in many guidance documents (see, for example, WMO 2010) is a visual fit. This approach provides minimal data on the uncertainty of the relationship and the reliability of any extrapolation of the relationship. This limits the estimation of the propagation of the uncertainty in the flood characteristic prediction approach; and&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;It has to describe a range of variation from no discharge through small but typical discharges to very large extreme flood events.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;&lt;/itemizedlist&gt;&lt;para&gt;As highlighted in the previous discussion, the unsteadiness of the discharge during a flood event (i.e. the variation of discharge with time) and its influence on a discharge estimate is ignored in the traditional application of a rating curve. In a flood event the slope of the water surface for a given stage will be different from that for the same stage during steady flow conditions; this difference will depend on whether the discharge is increasing or decreasing. As the flood increases, the surface slope in the river is greater than the slope for steady flow at the same stage, and hence, according to conventional hydraulic theory more water is flowing down the river than the rating curve would suggest. The effect of this is shown in &lt;xref linkend=&quot;b1_ch4_f_5gqn1&quot;/&gt;. When the water level is falling, the slope and, hence, the discharge inferred is less. The effects of this might be important - the peak discharge could be significantly underestimated during highly dynamic floods, and also since the maximum discharge and maximum stage do not coincide, the arrival time of the peak discharge could be in error and may influence flood warning predictions. Finally, the use of a discharge hydrograph derived inaccurately by using a single-valued rating relationship may distort estimates for resistance coefficients during calibration of an unsteady flow model.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;It might be expected by practitioners that good instructions and guidance would be provided by the International and Australian Standards (AS3778.2.3-2001), which are the same, the latter being a reproduction of the former. Another source of guidance is provided by WMO (2010). However, Fenton and Keller (2001) state:&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;emphasis&gt;“the Standards seem confusing and poorly prepared. In many places they state the obvious, but where sophisticated or modern methods are required, they have almost no serious guidance for practical implementation.”.&lt;/emphasis&gt;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Despite these issues, stage-discharge relationships form a foundation for the generation of the data necessary for the prediction of design flood characteristics.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section xml:id=&quot;b1_ch4_s_xx8wc&quot;&gt;&lt;title&gt;Extrapolation of Stage-Discharge Relationships&lt;/title&gt;&lt;para&gt;The stage-discharge relationship can be considered to consist of two zones; these zones are:&lt;/para&gt;&lt;itemizedlist&gt;&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;An interpolation zone where the relationship is within the range of the stage measurements used to develop the relationship; and&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;An extrapolation zone where the relationship is not defined by gaugings taken to develop the relationship.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;&lt;/itemizedlist&gt;&lt;para&gt;A diagrammatic illustration of these two zones is shown in &lt;xref linkend=&quot;b1_ch4_f_hez3n&quot;/&gt;.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;figure xml:id=&quot;b1_ch4_f_hez3n&quot;&gt;&lt;title&gt;Stage-Discharge Relationship Zones&lt;/title&gt;&lt;mediaobject&gt;&lt;imageobject&gt;&lt;imagedata contentdepth=&quot;60%&quot; fileref=&quot;../../figures/3005.jpg&quot; scalefit=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;/imageobject&gt;&lt;/mediaobject&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;para&gt;While it is preferable that all stage measurements are within the interpolation zone, the nature of the data needed for design flood estimation, and for flood prediction in general, the reliability of data from measurements within the extrapolation zone will require consideration of the extrapolation methodology. The need for extrapolation is shown in &lt;xref linkend=&quot;b1_ch4_f_a160s&quot;/&gt; where the discharges for the Annual Maxima Series extracted for Stream Gauge 222202&lt;emphasis role=&quot;bold&quot;&gt; &lt;/emphasis&gt;are plotted as a function of the rating ratio (the rating ratio is the ratio of the recorded discharge to the highest gauging used to develop the stage-discharge relationship). All points in the Annual Maxima Series where the rating ratio is greater than 1 require use of the extrapolation zone of the stage-discharge relationship.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;figure xml:id=&quot;b1_ch4_f_a160s&quot;&gt;&lt;title&gt;Annual Maximum Series&lt;/title&gt;&lt;mediaobject&gt;&lt;imageobject&gt;&lt;imagedata contentdepth=&quot;60%&quot; fileref=&quot;../../figures/1013.png&quot; scalefit=&quot;1&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot;/&gt;&lt;/imageobject&gt;&lt;/mediaobject&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;As shown in &lt;xref linkend=&quot;b1_ch4_f_a160s&quot;/&gt;, a number of the values in the Annual Maxima Series are in the extrapolation zone. The accuracy of the values in the extrapolation zone has the potential to influence fitting of the statistical model to the Annual Maxima Series, thereby influencing the predicted design flood quantiles. Fitting a statistical model to data points where the higher values are subject to estimate errors is discussed in &lt;xref linkend=&quot;b3_ch2&quot;/&gt;.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;There are a number of alternative techniques for development of the extrapolation zone of the stage-discharge relationship. The guidance provided by the International and Australian Standards is limited; a recommendation that a logarithmic extrapolation be used is included in the guidance. However, there is a recognition that extrapolation using logarithmic techniques needs to be confirmed through investigation of the station conditions.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;An alternative approach that has developed since development of computer based modelling systems is the use of a hydraulic model to develop the extrapolation zone of the stage-discharge relationship. Similar to the application of a logarithmic technique, the suitability of this approach needs to be confirmed prior to its application. Of particular concern is the modelling of the energy losses associated with flow in the channel and adjacent floodplains where it is necessary to assume that the parameter values obtained during calibration are suitable for the larger discharges being simulated in the extrapolation zone of the stage-discharge relationship.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The important point in this discussion, however, is a recognition that the values of the data extracted from a discharge record for fitting of a statistical model will contain values where the conversion of the recorded level to an equivalent discharge occurred through extrapolation of the stage-discharge relationship. Consideration of this in the fitting of a statistical model to the Annual Maxima Series is discussed later in &lt;xref linkend=&quot;b3_ch2&quot;/&gt;.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section xml:id=&quot;b1_ch4_s_86j19&quot;&gt;&lt;title&gt;Uncertainty of Discharge Measurements&lt;/title&gt;&lt;para&gt;The accuracy, or uncertainty, of a discharge measurement is very important for purposes of assessing the quality and reliability of that measurement. The concept of error and error analysis is a long-standing practice in the field of hydraulics and hydrology. The concept of uncertainty, however, is relatively new. Nonetheless, methods for evaluating, defining and expressing the uncertainty of streamflow measurements have developed.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Uncertainty and accuracy are terms that are sometimes used interchangeably even though they have two very distinct meanings. Accuracy (or error) refers to the agreement, or disagreement, between the measurement of stream discharge and the true or correct value of the discharge at the time of measurement. BecauseSince we can never know the true value of the discharge, we can never know the exact amount of error in the discharge measurement.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The uncertainty of a discharge measurement, on the other hand, acknowledges that no measurement is perfect. It is defined, therefore, as a parameter associated with the result of a measurement that characteriszes the dispersion of values that could reasonably be attributed to the measurement. It is typically expressed as a range of values in which the measurement value is estimated to lie, within a given statistical confidence. It does not attempt to define or rely on a unique true value. In summaryTo summarise, common usage of the word &apos;accuracy&apos; for quantitatively describing the characteristics of a discharge measurement is incompatible with its correct meaning. The proper term for expressing the statistical confidence of possible values for a discharge measurement is uncertainty.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The sources of uncertainty in discharge mesaurements can be categorised as:&lt;/para&gt;&lt;itemizedlist&gt;&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;Measurement - these are the uncertainties associated with taking the measurements. The primary component in this category is instrument accuracy; accuracy of both the velocity meter and the level recorder need to be considered.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;Methodology - these are the uncertainties associated with the analysis of the recorded measurements to enable the development of a point on the stage-discharge relationship. In this category, features such as the assumption of linear variation in the cross section between the bathymetric points, the assumption of a logarithmic vertical velocity profile, wind effects, changing stage during measurement, etc need to be considered.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;&lt;/itemizedlist&gt;&lt;para&gt;WMO Guidance (2010) on the likely standard errors encountered in undertaking a gauging point are&lt;/para&gt;&lt;itemizedlist&gt;&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;For rod suspension, the standard error ranges from 2% for an even, firm, smooth and stable streambed, to 10% for a mobile, shifting sand, or dunes streambed;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;For cable suspension, the standard error ranges from 2% to 15% for an unstable streambed, high velocity, and vertical angles; and&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;For acoustic depth measurements, the standard error ranges from 2% for a stable streambed to 10% for a mobile, shifting sand, and dunes streambed.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;&lt;/itemizedlist&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/section&gt;"?>
