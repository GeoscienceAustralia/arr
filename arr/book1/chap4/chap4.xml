    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>In an earlier chapter (cross reference to Chapter 3), the concept of
    design flood estimation as a problem in prediction of a statistical
    parameter that could be obtained from analysis of data was presented. In
    essence, this description defines the design flood problem as a problem in
    hydroinformatics. For this reason, some basic concepts of data and
    information are presented prior to the discussion of data relevant to
    design flood estimation, and the management of this data.</para>

      <title>Introduction to Hydroinformatics</title>

      <para>An important component in the prediction of design flood
      characteristics involves consideration of the data available for the
      purpose of predicting both the magnitude and probability of a flood
      characteristic. Since publication of the previous edition of Australian
      Rainfall and Runoff (Pilgrim, 1987), the increasing computational power
      available has seen changes in the availability and perceptions of data.
      These changing perceptions have resulted in the development of
      hydroinformatics as a conceptual framework for the many techniques and
      approaches for dealing with information about water in an electronic
      format.</para>

      <para>While Abbott (1992) first proposed the term “Hydroinformatics” as
      a generic term describing data and the utilisation of information and
      data about water, the most encompassing but concise definition of
      hydroinformatics was presented by Meynett and van Zuylen (1994) who
      stated:</para>

      <para><emphasis>“hydroinformatics deals with the electronic knowledge
      encapsulation of various sources of information related to the hydro
      sciences”. </emphasis></para>

      <para>Using this definition, it is apparent that hydroinformatics covers
      a wide range of subject areas which are not limited to the classical
      hydrological and hydraulic sciences involved in design flood prediction
      and management. Included in this definition would be data and
      information from the political, social, economical and legal spheres
      relevant to design flood events. As suggested from consideration of this
      definition, the scope of hydroinformatics is extensive. However, only
      those aspects relevant to prediction of design flood characteristics
      will be discussed in following sections.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Components of a Hydroinformatics System</title>

      <para>It is impossible to define all the components that together will
      constitute a hydroinformatics system since the need for each system and
      consequently the components will differ for each application. The
      concept, however, is that a hydroinformatics system deals with the
      processing of data in the hydro-environmental sciences. Therefore, any
      software that assists in this regard can be considered to form part of a
      hydroinformatics system.</para>

      <para>In general, the following components of the system would be
      expected for a system concerned with the prediction of design flood
      quantiles:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Databases for the storage, retrieval and display of spatial,
          temporal and statistical data;</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Models for prediction of design flood quantiles using the
          information contained in the relevant databases;</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Models for generation of data about catchment response to
          storm bursts or complete events; and</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Decision support systems for enhanced modelling and
          analysis.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>It is not the purpose of this document to discuss in complete
      detail all the aspects of a hydroinformatics system but rather to
      introduce the concept of a hydroinformatic system for design flood
      estimation in sufficient detail for design flood analysts. Further
      information on developments in and application of hydroinformatics
      systems can be found in Vathananukij and Malaikrisanachalee (2009),
      Malleron et al. (2011), Hersh (2012), Popescu et al., (2012), and Moya
      Quiroga, et al. (2013).</para>

    <title>Data</title>

    <section>
      <title>Data Types</title>

      <section>
        <title>General</title>

        <para>Data can be considered to be the values of qualitative or
        quantitative variables. While this definition is simple, the
        interaction of data with knowledge and data warrants discussion,
        particularly as the terms data, information and knowledge are
        frequently used for overlapping concepts.</para>

        <para>The main difference between these terms is in the level of
        abstraction being considered. Data is the lowest level of abstraction,
        information is the next level, and finally, knowledge is the highest
        level among all three. Data on its own carries no meaning. For data to
        become information, it must be interpreted and take on a meaning. For
        example, the height of Mt. Everest is considered generally as "data",
        a book on the geological characteristics of Mt. Everest may be
        considered as "information", while a report containing practical
        information on the best way to reach the peak of Mt. Everest may be
        considered as "knowledge". This distinction between the terms is
        consistent with Beynon-Davies (2002) who uses the concept of a sign to
        distinguish between data and information; data are symbols while
        information occurs when symbols are used to refer to something.</para>

        <para>In the following discussion of types of data, the lowest level
        of abstraction is being used, namely data has a value but no
        meaning.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Deterministic</title>

        <para>Deterministic data can be defined as data that has a unique
        value in spatial and temporal dimensions. There are many examples of
        deterministic data used in prediction of design flood quantiles; these
        examples include Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of the catchment, the
        surface roughness parameter, and the continuing loss rate
        parameter.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Probabilistic</title>

        <para>In contrast to deterministic data, probabilistic data does not
        have a unique value but rather has a range of values described by a
        statistical relationship. Each time a data value is sought from
        probabilistic data, the data value will be different. An example of a
        probabilistic parameter would be the continuing loss rate for use in a
        Monte Carlo simulation; in this example, the continuing loss rate will
        be sampled from the distribution of potential continuing loss rates
        with each sample likely to differ from previous samples.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Spatial</title>

        <para>Data can be unique to a point or spatial extent. Additionally,
        the data may vary in the spatial dimensions but invariant with time.
        There are many examples of spatial data types in design flood
        prediction; these examples include:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Soil types;</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Spatial patterns of rainfall; and</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Flood surface elevations</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Temporal</title>

        <para>Temporal data, in contrast to spatial data, consists of data
        that varies in the time dimension but, usually, has a fixed location
        in space. There are many examples of temporal data types in design
        flood prediction; these examples include:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Temporal patterns of rainfall; and</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Historical flood hydrographs.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Meta-data</title>

        <para>For optimal utility in the use of data, it is vital that
        potential users have the possibility of tracing the passage of data
        stored in an electronic database to its initial source. Questions such
        as “How were the values obtained ?”, “What is the reliability of the
        values ?”, “What editing of the data has occurred ?” are vital in
        assisting the data user to interpret the data in a manner appropriate
        for resolution of the issue under consideration. The development of
        hydroinformatic systems offers the possibility of facilitating access
        to meta-data and through this access to enhancing the utility of data.
        The inclusion of meta-data, therefore, is an essential and necessary
        aspect for suitable use of data in a hydroinformatic system.</para>

        <para>A further example of the utility of meta-data for interpretation
        of data is obtained from consideration of the data necessary for
        floodplain management. It is possible that a review of the meta-data
        contained within the hydroinformatic system used for flood management
        of the catchment may result in the finding that all data within the
        hydroinformatic system was derived from application of catchment
        modelling systems and that complementary monitored data was not
        available. The interpretation of the stored data, therefore, will be
        different from what would have been the case if the meta-data were not
        available and it had been assumed that the data were from catchment
        monitoring.</para>

        <para>It is worthwhile noting that prior to the widespread
        availability of computerised data (i.e. hydroinformatic systems), the
        analyst preparing the recommendation for freeboard probably would have
        been aware of the data sources (ie the meta-data) and, therefore,
        would have incorporated this knowledge into his interpretation and
        ultimate recommendation. Consequently, the inclusion of meta-data in
        the hydroinformatic system does not generate new knowledge in itself
        but merely incorporates knowledge currently available only in a
        non-electronic form.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Data Cycle</title>

      <para>Fundamental to the concept of hydroinformatics is the management
      of data and its passage from the time it is generated to the time when
      it used or presented to stakeholders and other interested parties.
      During this time, data can be considered to pass through a number of
      conceptual components. The passage of data through these components is
      not uniform and linear but rather will pass through the cycle in a
      random and nonuniform manner. The passage of the data and the components
      through which it passes can be considered as the data cycle (see Ball
      and Cordery, 2000).</para>

      <para>Conceptually, the data cycle is analogous to the hydrologic cycle;
      the passage of data through the data cycle can be considered analogous
      to the passage of water through the hydrologic cycle. Also, similar to
      the hydrologic cycle, the data cycle can be considered in a systems
      format with data flowing between the different components.</para>

      <para>If the data necessary for prediction of design flood
      characteristics is considered in this manner, then it is apparent that
      the components of the data cycle are relevant to the design flood
      problem. Hence the concepts associated with hydroinformatics and the
      data cycle are relevant to the prediction of design flood
      quantiles.</para>

      <para>One conceptual view of the components forming the data cycle is
      shown in Figure 1..1. The conceptual components shown in this figure are
      Generation, Editing, Storage, Analysis and Presentation. Also, as
      indicated in this figure, there is a circularity in the flow of
      information. This circularity arises from the analysis of data resulting
      in the generation of new data which will need to be edited and stored in
      a manner similar to previous data. Considered in this manner, an
      individual component within a hydroinformatic system is both a supplier
      and user of data.</para>

      <figure>
        <title>The Data Cycle</title>

        <mediaobject>

            <imagedata fileref="1001.PNG"/>
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>Within each of these conceptual components of the data cycle, the
      pertinent aspects are:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Generation</emphasis> - In this component the data
          is sourced; this can be restated as this is the component where the
          data is created or collected. Furthermore, it is the component where
          data is recognised as being relevant for prediction of the design
          flood characteristics.</para>

          <para>For example, in a catchment monitoring program aimed at
          collecting discharge data, the necessary steps, as discussed by Chow
          et al. (1988), would be:</para>

          <para><itemizedlist>
              <listitem>
                <para>sensing the phenomenon;</para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>recording the value of the phenomenon; and</para>
              </listitem>

              <listitem>
                <para>transmission of these values to a storage repository.
                This storage depository may be centralised or distributed
                according to the needs of the stakeholders involved.</para>
              </listitem>
            </itemizedlist>Further details on data creation through monitoring
          programs are presented later in this chapter; see <emphasis
          role="bold">cross reference to section 8 of this
          chapter.</emphasis></para>

          <para>In addition to the data generation through technical
          approaches, there are other methods of data generation; for example,
          data can be collected through social surveys, census surveys, and
          historical reviews. This data, similar to the technical data, will
          require management using the concepts of hydroinformatics and the
          data cycle.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Editing</emphasis> - An important aspect of data is
          knowledge of its accuracy (sometimes referred to as its uncertainty)
          and original source. Prior to insertion into a database, it is
          necessary to define these parameters; in other words, the relevant
          meta-data has to be attached to the data. The term meta-data is used
          here to describe the background material about the data which is
          referred to sometimes as the data about the data. Meta-data is
          discussed further in later sections of this chapter (cross reference
          to section 4.6).</para>

          <para>For monitored data, items of primary relevance include issues
          of how the data were observed, the reliability of the monitoring
          (for example, the sensitivity of the sensing equipment, the
          robustness of the rating table for monitored discharges, the
          detection limit of contaminants for water quality constituents), and
          editing changes to the data and the philosophy behind these changes.
          These meta-data are of great importance for monitoring of catchments
          since at least some of the monitored data will be inaccurate; in
          other words, some of the monitored data will contain undiscovered
          errors.</para>

          <para>In a similar manner, data generated by catchment modelling
          systems needs to be defined by the software (and version) used, the
          input data inclusive of adopted parameter values or distribution of
          parameter values. It is worthwhile noting that input data covers
          both the parameters necessary for operation of the software and the
          data necessary for implementation of the modelling system. This data
          is discussed in more detail in Book 7. It is sufficient here to
          state that the editing of data generated from catchment modelling
          systems, i.e. the attachment of meta-data, should be sufficient to
          define how the data was generated and to enable replication.</para>

          <para>The step involving editing of the data is a vital part of the
          data cycle and it should take place prior to the insertion of the
          data into the relevant database and its subsequent usage by others
          who were not involved in its generation. The inclusion of the
          meta-data and its availability to future users is becoming
          increasingly important as the availability of digital data increases
          and data users become more remote from the generation of the
          data.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Storage</emphasis> - The storage of the data is
          performed in this component of the data cycle. In general, the
          storage of data will comprise the insertion of the data into a
          digital database. It is important to note that the manner of data
          storage should ensure that its retrieval is both practical and
          feasible. If retrieval is not easy, there is no addition to the data
          available for design flood estimation.</para>

          <para>There are many different forms of data stored in a database
          which in turn influences the data storage design. Commonly, spatial
          databases are referred to as Geographic Information Systems (GIS)
          while databases used to store temporal data can be referred to as a
          Time-Series Managers (TSM). These computerised storage facilities
          have superseded, in general, the previous techniques based on data
          storage through maps and charts. There are a large number of
          alternative GISs and TSMs that can be used for data storage. It is
          not the purpose of Australian Rainfall and Runoff to recommend a
          particular GIS or TSM but rather to note their use for storing data
          relevant to design flood estimation.</para>

          <para>Since 2008, the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) has been
          responsible for delivering water data throughout Australia. As part
          of this role, the BoM has been collecting water data from more than
          200 organisations across the nation and is using this data to report
          on water availability, condition and use in a nationally consistent
          way. To facilitate this role, the BoM is building the Australian
          Water Resources Information System (AWRIS) as a secure repository
          for water data and as a means to deliver high quality water data to
          all Australians.</para>

          <para>The aim of AWRIS is to allow the Bureau of Meteorology to
          process and publish water data in new and powerful ways. The Bureau
          of Meteorology will be able to merge historical water data records
          with current observations to suit a variety of user needs. By
          spatially enabling this data we will be able to query and report the
          data in many different ways. Data stored in AWRIS will be delivered
          to the web, to mobile devices and various hydrologic forecasting
          systems to be operated by the BoM. <emphasis role="bold">need
          published reference to awris</emphasis></para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Analysis</emphasis> - It is common that analysis of
          data will be required. The analysis techniques form this component
          of the data cycle. The steps involved in this component can be
          summarised as data retrieval, and data usage. It is worth noting
          that the data obtained from the analysis could be considered as part
          of the data generation component. Hence there is some similarity
          between the generation and analysis components.</para>

          <para>There are many alternative analysis techniques. For design
          flood estimation purposes, the most commonly used analysis
          techniques would be statistical modelling (for example, flood
          frequency analysis) and catchment response modelling using a
          catchment modelling system. Both of these techniques result in the
          generation of additional data that, in turn, requires editing and
          storage..</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Presentation</emphasis> - The final conceptual
          component is the presentation component. Within this step, the
          stored data or analysed data is presented in a manner that is
          understandable to relevant stakeholders. The technical level of the
          presented data would not be constant for all presentations but,
          rather, would vary with the technical expertise of the audience. The
          important point about the presentation of data is that it is
          presented in a manner that is clear and precise for the
          audience.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Forms of Data</title>

      <para>Data needed for modelling of design flood characteristics is
      varied due to the different types of problems requiring design flood
      characteristics, the needs of the alternative analysis techniques and
      the different software packages used in prediction of design flood
      quantiles. In addition, the data may be deterministic or probabilistic
      with varying degrees of reliability (i.e. uncertainty). For example,
      topographic data is essentially deterministic but different model scales
      and different topographic sampling techniques will produce variations in
      the topographic data available for the model user. Furthermore,
      different techniques for production of the topographic data will result
      in variations in the stored values. This highlights the need for
      “meta-data” about the data used in the analysis; the topographic data
      forms part of the input data for catchment modelling systems and changes
      in this data are likely to result in variations in the predicted design
      flood characteristics.</para>

      <para>An additional source of data variability is introduced by
      alternative users having different approaches to the implementation of
      the same process model, catchment modelling system and data. While there
      may be consensus regarding the model approximations, the different
      traditions and cultures of alternative modellers will result in
      variations to the steps of data collation, model implementation
      (building), model calibration and validation, and, finally, model
      application being different. The end result is that no two modellers
      will develop identical models for the same application and hence there
      will be variations in the predicted design flood characteristics . This
      further highlights the importance of meta-data to both the data stored
      within the hydroinformatic system and to the predicted design flood
      characteristics.</para>

      <para>A simple example of this concept is determination of which
      parameter should be adjusted during model calibration for the non-linear
      reservoir model employed within the hydrologic component of the
      Stormwater Management Model (Huber and Dickinson, 1988). If the
      simulated catchment response is too quick, it is possible to increase
      the individual subcatchment lags by increasing the representative length
      of the subcatchment (analogous to decreasing the representative width of
      the catchment), by increasing the surface roughness of the subcatchment,
      by decreasing the representative slope of the subcatchment, or by some
      combination of these alternatives. Often the choice of approach in this
      situation will be dependent on the experience, expertise, and personal
      preferences of the modeller.</para>

      <para>Despite this variability in data needs and usage, it is possible
      to categorise data used for modelling catchment response or produced
      from the analysis of catchment response into generic forms which
      are:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Temporal</emphasis> - this data is fixed in location
          but vary in the time dimension. An example of temporally variable
          data is a flood hydrograph at a specified location;</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Spatial</emphasis> - this data is fixed in time but
          will vary with location. Furthermore, spatial data may relate to an
          area or to a specific location. Land use distribution and flood
          extent are examples of spatial data relevant to an area while a
          stream gauge location is an example of spatial data relevant to a
          point; and</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Probabilistic</emphasis> - these data do not have
          deterministic values but rather have values that are defined in
          terms of a probability density function. An example of probabilistic
          data is the conceptual loss rate for a catchment used in many
          runoff-routing techniques. Typically, this loss rate will have a
          distribution of values rather than a single unique value and, hence,
          could be expressed by parameters defining a probability
          distribution.</para>

    <title>Historical Flood Data</title>

    <section>
      <title>Overview</title>

      <para>Historical flood information is important as it often can provide
      a significant improvement in the quality and reliability of the
      predicted flood characteristics. While data on historical floods may be
      difficult to obtain at times, efforts expended in finding and analysing
      these data are extremely valuable. Regardless of the quality of the
      data, predicted design flood characteristics will be improved through
      consideration of historical data.</para>

      <para>Typically, information on the historical flood behaviour is
      collected immediately after the event but often this information is not
      collated until there is a need for the data. Historical flood data,
      therefore, will have differing reliability; this needs to be considered
      when the data is used as part of the analysis. Nonetheless, all
      historical flood data will assist in the estimation of design flood
      characteristics.</para>

      <para>There are many types of historical flood data; these are discussed
      in the following sections.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Historical Rainfall Data</title>

      <para>The Bureau of Meteorology is the primary agency responsible for
      collection of rainfall data in Australia, but there are many other
      agencies which have significant records of rainfall data. These other
      agencies include local authorities and water agencies. However, some
      private organisations also collect rainfall data that may be useful in
      specific projects.</para>

      <para>Most publicly available rainfall data should be available through
      the Bureau of Meteorology’s AWRIS database; this database is discussed
      later under climatic data.</para>

      <para>The types of rainfall data that may be useful include:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Daily rainfall records; and</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Pluviometer records.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Normally data endorsed by the Bureau of Meteorology can be
      regarded as suitable for purpose. Users should still check the data for
      consistency and reasonableness. In particular, tests for missing or
      accumulated data need to be considered. Also, the potential for gauge
      overflows should be assessed.</para>

      <para>There are alternative approaches to the measurement of rainfall
      using tipping bucket rain gauges. One approach is to measure the time of
      occurrence of a tip while the other approach is to record the number of
      tips in a given time period. Recording the number of tips in a given
      period is consistent with the approach used for daily rainfall
      records.</para>

      <para>While both approaches have validity, there is a need to ensure
      that, when the latter approach is used, the given time period is less
      than the desired time increment required for the analysis be undertaken.
      It is worth noting that this issue is valid also when the data extracted
      from a digital database was derived from digitisation of a chart record;
      the digitisation approach will influence the information content of the
      digitised data.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Historical Streamflow Data</title>

      <para>Streamflow data can be in one of two forms:</para>

      <para><itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>Event Gauging</emphasis> - Gauging of an event has
            been undertaken at a location for the development of a rating
            curve or table; in other words, for the development of a
            conversion relationship for the measured stage to a measured
            discharge.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>Derived Discharge Hydrograph -
            </emphasis>Discharges can be derived at a water level gauge
            location using a stage-discharge (rating) curve. An understanding
            of the quality of streamflow data can be gained from the
            examination of rating tables and gaugings developed for a gauge
            (refer to section on streamflow later in this chapter). The
            reliability of the streamflow data for a large flood event is
            limited by the amount of extrapolation required beyond the highest
            gauging of the rating curve. Further details are provided in later
            sections of this chapter.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>Both forms of historical data can be useful for
      estimation of design flood characteristics. However, neither form of
      historical streamflow data should be considered error free and users
      need to be cognisant of the likely magnitudes of these errors. This
      information should be conveyed in the meta-data attached to the
      historical streamflow data when it is extracted from a digital
      database.</para>

      <para>With all historical flood behaviour data, the nature of the
      collected data needs to be assessed when considering the reliability of
      the data point and its information content.</para>

    <title>Climate Data</title>

    <section>
      <title>Introduction to Climatic Data</title>

      <para>Climate records are one of the basic sources of data used in
      estimating surface water resources and the variability of these
      resources in space and time. The records, therefore, are used in the
      planning and design of surface water related projects, and also in the
      management or operation of the projects after construction of the
      projects has been completed.</para>

      <para>In addition, climate records are used for calibrating catchment
      modelling systems which, for example, are used for predicting flood
      behaviour and hazards arising from design flood events. Records of
      rainfalls obtained at rain gauges also serve as one of the basic data
      sources for design rainfall.</para>

      <para>It is essential, therefore, to have valid records of rainfall in
      the space and time dimensions to obtain an understanding of its
      magnitude and likelihood. The following discussion of how rainfall data
      is collected is necessary for users of that data to be able to assess
      the validity of the data and hence its suitability for purpose.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Rainfall Observations</title>

      <para>The standard instrument for manual measurement of rainfall is the
      203mm rain gauge (see Figure 1..2). In essence, this instrument is a
      circular funnel with a diameter of 203mm which collects the rain into a
      graduated and calibrated cylinder. The measuring cylinder can record up
      to 20mm of precipitation. Any excess precipitation is captured in the
      outer metal cylinder. The top of the rain gauge (i.e. the top of the
      funnel) should be located 0.3m above the ground surface. Most manually
      read gauges are used for daily observations.</para>

      <para>Daily rainfall is nominally measured each day at 9:00 am local
      time. At the majority of rainfall sites, observations are taken by
      volunteers who send in a monthly record of daily precipitation at the
      end of each month. A subset of observers at strategic locations, as well
      as automatic weather stations, send observations electronically to the
      Bureau of Meteorology each day. Very few stations have a complete
      unbroken record of climate information. Missed observations may be due
      to observer illness or equipment failure. If, for some reason, an
      observation is unable to be made, the next observation is recorded as an
      accumulation, since the rainfall has been accumulating in the rain gauge
      since the last reading.</para>

      <para><figure>
          <title>Standard Rain Gauge</title>

          <mediaobject>

            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </figure>An alternative to the manual measurement is to use a
      continuous recording rain gauge resulting in either an analogue chart
      record or a digital record. While some chart recorders remain in
      operation, the more common form of continuous rain gauges is the Tipping
      Bucket Rain Gauge (see Figure 1..3). Like the manual rain gauge, the
      aperture of the funnel for a TBRG is 203 mm.</para>

      <figure>
        <title>Tipping Bucket Rain Gauge</title>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="../../figures/placeholder.png"/>
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>Advantages of the TBRG are claimed to include unattended,
      automatic operation, and the ability to record the rate at which the
      rain is falling. Operation of a TBRG is based on the generation of an
      electronic pulse when the volume of water collected in the bucket
      results in the bucket tipping. While the usual volume of water collected
      is equivalent to a depth of 0.2mm, some early TBRGs required a depth of
      0.5mm before the bucket would tip. When analysing data from TBRGs, users
      should check the bucket size to ensure the validity of the analysis;
      this information should be available from the meta-data attached to the
      recorded data.</para>

      <para>Traditionally rainfall is measured to the nearest 0.2mm (prior to
      1974 records were in Imperial units and measurements were to the nearest
      1 point). However, in recent years some observations have been reported
      to 0.1mm.</para>

      <para>The Bureau of Meteorology undertake a number of quality control
      processes to detect errors in the rainfall data forwarded from the many
      volunteer and professional readers. This data checking includes:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Values that extend beyond what is considered realistic;</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Inconsistent observations (for example, high rainfall combined
          with clear skies); and</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Discontinuous or abrupt changes in values over a short period
          of time.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>While the Bureau of Meteorology undertakes these checks it is
      recommended that individual users ensure that their rainfall data is
      suitable for purpose. This may entail undertaking additional quality
      control processes.</para>

    <section>
      <title>Rainfall Databases</title>

      <para>The Bureau of Meteorology has developed a number of databases for
      storage of rainfall data and its meta-data. These databases
      include:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Australian Data Archive for Meteorology (ADAM);</para>

      <section>
        <title>Australian Data Archive for Meteorology</title>

        <para>The Australian Data Archive for Meteorology (ADAM) stores
        meteorological observations from observing systems over mainland
        Australia and from neighbouring islands, the Antarctic, ships and
        ocean buoys that are operated by the Bureau of Meteorology. It also
        stores a limited number of observations from other local and
        international sources to support research and improve Bureau of
        Meteorology services.</para>

        <para>The most common observation type stored in ADAM is daily
        rainfall. Dating back to the mid-1800s, these total more than 200
        million records from a network of over 16000 locations. Other types of
        weather data that are stored in ADAM include air temperature,
        humidity, wind velocity, sunshine, cloud cover, soil temperatures,
        upper atmospheric wind and temperature, and observed weather phenomena
        (for example, thunder, frost and dust).</para>

        <para>To support this large database, the ADAM system contains
        supporting database tables and software tools required to enter,
        retrieve and quality control data efficiently. A set of detailed rules
        and procedures ensure consistent treatment of information.</para>

        <title>Australian Water Resources Information System</title>

        <para>The Bureau of Meteorology is building the Australian Water
        Resources Information System (AWRIS) as a secure repository for water
        data and as a means to deliver high quality water information to all
        Australians. Under the Water Regulations 2008, the Bureau of
        Meteorology receives information about river discharges and
        groundwater levels, water volumes in storage, water quality in rivers
        and aquifers, water use and restrictions, water entitlements and water
        trades. The intention is that AWRIS will store and manage this data in
        a central database.</para>

        <para>To achieve this aim, AWRIS is a powerful hydroinformatic system
        capable of receiving, standardising, organising and interpreting water
        data from across the nation. The Australian Hydrological Geospatial
        Fabric (also known as the Geofabric) is a vital component of AWRIS. It
        is a specialised Geographic Information System that enables a spatial
        context to the data stored within AWRIS. With this spatial context,
        the utility of water data of the data will be enhanced through ease of
        access. Additionally, the Geofabric encodes the spatial connections
        and relationships between most of Australia’s hydrological features
        including rivers, dams, lakes, aquifers, diversions, supply channels,
        drains and monitoring points.</para>

      <para>Catchment data is an essential component of the estimation of
      design flood characteristics. There are a number of different types of
      catchment data required. Furthermore, data is available from a number of
      different sources and with a range of accuracies. In general, it is

        data collection can have a significant impact on the cost effective
        delivery of flood investigations. The scope of the required
        topographic and infrastructure data is driven by the nature of flood

        <para>Discussed in this section are details of the scoping of the
        field survey component for an investigation for design flood
        estimation. The focus is on those features where field survey is
        needed to capture the desired information. These features
        include:</para>

            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>While it is possible to obtain existing field survey
        data from other sources, it is important to assess the suitability of
        this data for the intended purpose. In other words, it is necessary to
        obtain both the data and the meta-data. Included in the meta-data
        should be items related to date of capture, accuracy, etc.</para>

        <section>
          <title>Cross-Sections</title>

          <para>A survey of crossisections is required only when the design
          flood estimation requires the application of a catchment modelling
          system to generate data that is not available from a catchment
          monitoring program. Hence, the scope of a cross-section survey
          depends on the type of the catchment modelling being used. Where the
          catchment modelling is focussed on hydrologic simulation (using, for
          example, a conceptual rainfall-runoff model), the cross -section
          data required is minimal. However, where the catchment modelling
          requires hydraulic simulation (using, for example, a one-dimensional
          network model), the cross-section data required will be more
          extensive.</para>

          <para>The important characteristics of the cross-section data
          include the lateral extent and longitudinal spacing of
          cross-sections. The lateral extent of the cross-section must be
          sufficient to include key in-bank elements. Erring on the
          conservative side is wise with the cross-section extending up to at
          least the top-of-bank. When surveying in-bank cross-sections, good
          field notes and/or photos describing the nature of the channel are
          vital for proper interpretation post collection. There are numerous
          references such as Stewardson and Howes (2002) that describe flood
          study cross-section survey requirements in detail. The overriding
          principle being that the cross-section data is adequate to estimate
          the shape and slope of the channel so that suitable estimates of the
          flow conveyance capacity of the channel can be calculated.</para>

          <para>The influence of in-bank features on flood discharge behaviour
          tends to reduce as the magnitude of the flood discharges increases.
          For example, bank-full capacity of a river channel may represent
          100% of a 0.2 or 0.5 EY discharge but less than 10% of a 1% AEP
          discharge.<emphasis role="bold"> (Reference
          needed)</emphasis></para>

          <para>When the catchment modelling for design flood estimation
          requires consideration of floodplain discharges, then cross-sections
          of the entire floodplain inclusive of the channel are required. This
          requirement is particularly relevant to catchment modelling systems
          using one-dimensional hydraulic modelling techniques. More details
          of this modelling approach are presented in <xref
          linkend="book7"/>.</para>

          <para>In these circumstances, the cross-sections can be spaced more
          widely than when only in-bank flood discharges need to be
          considered. Ideally, cross-sections are provided at break-out points
          to the floodplain and at all locations where there is a significant
          change in channel characteristics, such as conveyance. Additionally,
          it is worthwhile to include survey breaklines along the tops of the
          banks to provide an additional aid for the hydraulic modelling of
          overbank breakouts during design (or historical) flood
          events.</para>

          <para>It is also worth noting that field practicalities such as bank
          vegetation, access to the channel and water depth may influence the
          actual location of the cross-sections surveyed.</para>

        <section>
          <title>Structures and Drainage Infrastructure</title>

          <para>Structures in the waterway and on the floodplain may have a
          significant influence on flood behaviour. Structures requiring
          survey include:</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>Levees;</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Road and rail embankments;</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Hydraulic structures such as weirs, bridges and culverts;
              and</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Drainage infrastructure such as pipes and pits.</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>

          <para>Often these structures constrict and obstruct flood discharges
          thereby influencing the design flood estimation. The effects on
          flood behaviour may be intentional (such as a weir) or unintentional
          (such as blockage at a culvert). Where the effect on flood discharge
          is unintentional, it is worth noting that the effect may be
          stochastic and hence the likelihood of the effect needs to be
          considered by a suitable joint probability technique. Irrespective
          of whether the influence is intentional or unintentional, these
          structures will have an influence on the estimation of the design
          flood characteristic.</para>

          <para>Hydraulic structures generally act to control the discharge
          behaviour in accordance with a particular management strategy. As
          most management strategies are concerned with frequent discharges,
          there are control structures designed to operate under flood
          conditions as part of an operational flood management strategy.
          Hence, the impact of these structures will vary with the management
          strategy and flood magnitude.</para>

          <para>The purpose of a levee is to divert discharges as part of an
          operational flood management strategy. As part of this strategy,
          levees are designed only to protect floodplains for a specified
          portion of the relationship between the likelihood and magnitude of
          a flood event; in other words, there is a defined probability that a
          levee can be overtopped (with or without failure of the levee bank)
          by a flood rarer than the levee was designed to protect against.
          Hence, in design flood estimation, the geometric properties of a
          levee are important to enable suitable estimation of the flood
          magnitudes (and hence probabilities) of design events likely to
          result in hydrologic (and/or structural) failure of the
          levee.</para>

          <para>Geometric details of these structures are required. These
          details include:</para>

          <title>Traditional Ground Survey</title>

          <para>Traditional ground survey (that is, survey collected by
          traditional or total station ground survey techniques) is the most
          accurate survey technique with vertical and horizontal accuracies as
          shown in Table 1..1. However, this technique is manual and labour
          intensive. As a result, this technique is best suited to small
          and/or difficult areas for other techniques, to supplement data
          obtained from other techniques, and to validate data obtained from
          other techniques.</para>

          <title>Real Time Kinematic Global Positioning Systems and
          Differential Global Positioning Systems</title>

          <para>Real Time Kinematic Global Positioning Systems (RTK GPS)
          involves the coordinated use and comparison of two Global
          Positioning Systems (GPS) using the same satellite signals. The
          first GPS, sometimes referred to as the "base station", is
          positioned over a known location (typically a permanent survey mark)
          and maintains a continuous record of the location relative to
          numerous satellite positions. The second GPS, referred to as a
          “roving GPS”, can be hand held or mounted to a car, boat or
          all-terrain vehicle; this unit collects data defining the location
          of the roving GPS position from the same satellites. The accuracy of
          the roving GPS location is enhanced by comparison of the satellite
          signals for the two stations. Shown in Figure 1..4 is the concept
          underpinning field survey using RTK GPS techniques.</para>

          <para>RTK GPS has the advantage that it can collect a reasonable
          amount of data at higher accuracy than remote sensed data and much
          faster than by traditional means. The disadvantage is that if the
          vehicle in which the RTK GPS is mounted is unable to access an area,
          the system may have to be dismantled to gain access by some other
          means or measurement of data is not possible in the inaccessible
          area. RTK GPS methods also rely on the instrument having line of
          sight access to an array of satellites. This can be a limitation to
          the technique in areas underneath a tree canopy.</para>

        <title>Airborne Techniques</title>

        <para>Defining flood behaviour within an area containing overland
        flowpaths requires extensive topographic data. Aerial techniques are
        well suited to the capture of this topographic data across a broad
        area. Commonly, this topographic data is represented as a Digital
        Elevation Model (DEM). It should be noted that there is no universal
        definition of the terms Digital Elevation Model (DEM), Digital Terrain
        Model (DTM) and Digital Surface Model (DSM) in the scientific
        literature. In most cases the term, DSM represents the earth's surface
        and includes all objects on it. In contrast to a DSM, the DTM
        represents the bare ground surface without any objects like plants and
        buildings. Both DTM and DSM may be referred to as DEM.</para>

        <para>Usually, a DEM is represented as a raster (a grid of squares) or
        as a vector-based Triangular Irregular Network (TIN). According to
        Toppe (1987), the TIN DEM dataset is referred to as a primary
        (measured) DEM, whereas the Raster DEM is referred to as a secondary
        (computed) DEM; this definition, however, predates the widespread
        availability of Airborne Laser Scanning (ALS) (also known as Light
        Detection and Ranging - LiDAR) data for definition of the catchment
        surface topography.</para>

        <para>Before embarking on any aerial data capture, it is worth
        liaising with other agencies who may hold topographic data to ensure
        that the existing spatial extent of data does not cover the desired
        area.</para>

        <para>At present, the two principal techniques used in aerial survey
        for obtaining topographic data are:</para>

            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>A general description of photogrammetry is that it is
        the science of making measurements from photographs; in the context
        being used herein, it is the science of making measurements about the
        topographic surface of catchments. Generally, topographic data
        obtained through photogrammetry consists of spot elevations plus
        linear breaklines. The topographic surface is then determined from the
        TIN model through the spot elevations. The breaklines are lines in the
        TIN that represents distinct interruptions in the slope of a surface,
        such as a ridge, road, or stream. No triangle in a TIN may cross a
        breakline (in other words, breaklines are enforced as triangle edges).
        Elevation levels along a breakline can be constant or variable.</para>

        <para>ALS or LiDAR is a remote sensing technology that measures
        distance by illuminating a target (in this case, the ground surface)
        with a laser and analysing the reflected light. Raw ALS data consists
        of a dense cloud of spot elevations classified into ground and
        non-ground strikes. This raw ALS data usually has the non-ground
        strikes removed prior to provision. Analysis of the raw ALS data will
        result in a raster DEM.</para>

        <para>It should be noted that neither photogrammetry or ALS can
        penetrate water surfaces. Only the water surface level at the time of
        capture is able to be measured. If the bathymetry under the water
        surface is relevant in the context of the numerical modelling,
        bathymetric data must be collected and incorporated separately.
        Similarly, neither method can penetrate dense vegetation (such as
        trees, sugar cane and mangroves) to produce ground elevations. In
        general, ground survey may be necessary to fill gaps in the
        topographic data under heavy vegetation.</para>

        <para>It is important in a DEM to ensure key linear features such as
        levees, embankments and other infrastructure are adequately
        represented. These features can be incorporated into the topographic
        description using field data as breaklines.</para>

        <para>The ANZLIC Committee on Surveying and Mapping have developed
        guidelines on the acquisition of LiDAR (ANZLIC, 2008) in terms of
        accuracy, data formats and meta-data. They have also developed the
        National Elevation Data Framework.</para>

        <para>Further discussion of these two aerial survey techniques is
        provided in the following sections.</para>

        <section>
          <title>Photogrammetry</title>

          <para>Photogrammetry is a measurement technique where the three
          dimensional (x,y,z) coordinates of an object are determined by
          measurements made from a stereo image consisting of two (or more)
          photographs; usually, these photographs are taken from different
          passes of an aerial photography flight. In this technique, the
          common points are identified on each image. A line of sight (or ray)
          can be built from the camera location to the point on the object. It
          is the intersection of its rays (triangulation) which determines the
          relative 3D position of the point. Known control points can be used
          to give these relative positions absolute values. More sophisticated
          algorithms can exploit other information on the scene known as
          priori.</para>

          <para>The accuracy of the photogrammetric data is a function of the
          flying height, scale of the photography and the number and density
          of control points. Typically, the accuracy requested when scoping
          photogrammetric data collection for flood study purposes ranges from
          +/- 0.1 m to +/- 0.3 m. Note that the accuracy of the developed
          design flood profile cannot have an accuracy better than the
          catchment data used to estimate the design flood profile.</para>

          <para>As the technique is based upon the comparison of photographic
          images, shading and obscuring of the ground surface by vegetation
          can reduce coverage in specific areas. However, as photogrammetric
          analysis can utilise manual inspection of the stereo pair of
          photographs, the photogrammetrist is sometimes able to pick the odd
          ground surface visible through tree or crop cover. In this way,
          photogrammetry is sometimes able to provide some reliable points in
          vegetated areas.</para>

          <para>Shown in Figure 1..5 is a region over which photogrammetric
          data coverage and ALS data coverage will be demonstrated. Shown in
          Figure 1..6 is a typical sample of the raw data obtained from a
          photogrammetric technique while shown in Figure 1..7 is the raw data
          in finer detail for the area indicated in Figure 1..6. These figures
          demonstrate the following specifically in relation to
          photogrammetry:</para>

              tops and bottom of banks. These are most likely to have been
              manually derived by viewing the stereo pair of
              photographs.</para>

          <title>Airborne Laser Scanning</title>

          <para>Airborne Laser Scanner (ALS) or LiDAR consists of a high
          frequency laser emitter and scanner, coupled with a Global
          Positioning System (GPS) and an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), all
          mounted in fixed winged aircraft. Rapid pulses of light are fired
          toward the earth by the laser instrument. These light pulses rebound
          from a target and are sensed. The scanner records the time
          differential between the emission of the laser pulses and the
          reception of the return signal. The time taken is used to determine
          the distance between the emitter and the target. The position and
          orientation of the scanner is determined using differential
          kinematic GPS and the IMU to account for aircraft pitch.</para>

          <para>ALS produces a dense cloud of points (See Figure 1..8, 9).
          These points can be classified as ground or non-ground points. While
          ALS requires little ground control in acquisition, ground control is
          important for quality control of the ALS measurements. For example,
          while it may be easy to scan inaccessible or sensitive areas without
          ground survey, the accuracy and reliability of the collected data
          may be low; in other words, ground control is important for ensuring
          the accuracy and reliability of the ALS measurements.</para>

          <para>The vertical and horizontal accuracy of ground surface level
          measurement by ALS is a function of the laser specification, flying
          height, ground control and the surface coverage. Hard road surfaces,
          for example, normally are able to be measured accurately, but other
          surface types (for example, swamps or heavily vegetated areas) are
          not easy to measure and hence the measurements must be treated with
          caution. It is useful to note that many quoted accuracy values for
          ALS data are in reference to the data accuracy for clear hard
          ground. For clear, hard ground (that is ground with no surface
          coverage), the nominal accuracy for technology commonly applied in
          Australia is:</para>

            </table>A disadvantage of the ALS data capture method (compared
          to, for example, low-level photogrammetry) is the absence of
          breaklines in the data to define distinct, continuous topographic
          features and significant changes in grade. While the horizontal
          density of points usually is quite high ( average point spacing of 1
          to 2 metres depending on flying height and sampling frequency),
          features such as narrow banks/levees or channels will only be
          resolved if the data are sampled on a very small grid (less than 1
          to 2m grid). This can result in large and unwieldy terrain
          files.</para>

          <para>There are a number of approaches that can be taken in relation
          to the treatment of breaklines in ALS data sets:</para>

          <orderedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>Sample the entire survey area at a fine resolution - say
              on a regularly spaced 1m Digital Elevation Model (DEM) grid and
              manually identify important salient topographic features and
              hand enter these features into the models;</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Use local knowledge, GIS, aerial photos, satellite imagery
              or historic plans to identify locations of important features
              and hand-digitise over the fine resolution DEM in a manner
              similar to the first approach (approach 1) and then drape values
              from the DEM to develop 3D breakline strings;</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Use observations as in approach 2 to determine locations
              of key features and then use field survey to develop 3D
              breakline strings; and</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Use auto-processing/filtering algorithms to extract
              breaklines from the raw ALS data.</para>
            </listitem>
          </orderedlist>

          <para>Experienced users favour a combination of techniques
          approaches (2), (3) and (4). While approach (4) nominally provides
          the widest coverage and extracts the most information from the ALS
          data, the processes cannot be considered reliable as no method has
          been developed for testing the validity of the breaklines
          produced.</para>

          <para>Although requiring a greater manual input, it is considered
          that approaches (2) and (3) are better approaches for the provision
          of reliable estimates of the surface level at critical locations
          with in the floodplain. This arises from the manual checking that
          occurs during the progress of approaches (2) and (3). Furthermore,
          long-sections from the ALS can be checked for consistency and a
          sub-sample tested against field measurements as a validation
          process.</para>

          <para>Capturing ALS data results in surface level estimates from
          various ground coverages including bare earth, vegetation, and
          buildings. Thorough processing of this raw data is required to
          ensure a true representation of the ground surface is
          obtained.</para>

          <para>Raw ALS data files contain all returns can be very large
          leading to difficulties with data storage and the manipulation of
          this data. As a result, a common approach is to use “thinned" ALS
          data; this is data that has been processed to remove data points
          providing limited additional definition of the terrain surface.
          Shown in Figure 1..9 is an example of the processed ALS dataset to
          produce the thinned ALS dataset. Illustrated in this figure are the
          following aspects:</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>The measured spot heights are provided as a grid; in other
              words, each spot height is representative of an area defined by
              the grid dimensions. This grid has been created by "thinning"
              the raw ALS point cloud dataset. While the dimensions of the
              grid are defined by the user, it is useful to note that the
              smaller the grid, the larger and perhaps more unwieldy the
              dataset being used but the surface topography will have an
              apparent higher definition. Conversely, the larger the grid, the
              smaller the dataset but the surface topography will have an
              apparent lower definition. It is also worth noting that
              definition of the surface topography only needs to be adequate
              to provide the necessary information and that any additional
              definition will not provide either additional flood data or
              accuracy of the predicted flood data.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>There are no breaklines in the model of the surface
              topography. Breaklines can be created according to the
              approaches discussed previously but typically are not determined
              solely from the ALS data.</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>Areas where there are no measurements and hence no points
              available to build the model of the surface topography. In these
              areas, the ground surface was not visible due to, for example,
              heavy vegetation or surface water. These areas can be removed
              during the processing as "non-ground" points. When using a
              processed ALS dataset, there will be situations where a
              non-ground elevation point (for example, a point that has hit
              the canopy of trees) has not been removed during processing. As
              a result, the spot elevation remains in the dataset and would be
              treated as a surface elevation. In some situations. Errors of
              this type are obvious and can be removed manually. In other
              situations, they may not be obvious and hence will form part of
              the DEM (Digital Elevation Model) used in the analysis. Users
              need to be cognisant of errors of this type in ALS data and the
              consequent significant impacts on the predictions obtained from
              the catchment modelling system.</para>

          <title>Aerial Survey Quality Checks</title>

          <para>As discussed in <emphasis role="bold">cross reference to
          earlier section on accuracy, </emphasis>survey data is not exact and
          will have a tolerance or a stated level of accuracy. Data obtained
          from aerial survey is the same. With data obtained from aerial
          survey, accuracy is dependent upon a number of factors, including
          flying height and the number of control points. In general, the
          required accuracy is advised prior to commencement of data
          collection and the surveyor designs the data collection program
          needed to achieve the desired accuracy.</para>

          <para>An important point to note is that the accuracy of the
          collected data is checked and confirmed. The resultant stated
          accuracy typically does not apply to the DTM derived from the survey
          data but rather to the individual elevation points sampled during
          the data generation program. This is an important distinction and
          users of a DTM derived from aerial survey data needs to be aware of
          this feature.</para>

          <para>There are a number of methods that may be used to check the
          accuracy of the aerial survey.</para>

              <para>POINT vs DTM SURFACE: Independent field surveys of
              selected quality check points can be compared to the DTM.
              However, this surface has been interpolated from the aerial
              elevation data and, unless the accuracy stated by the aerial
              surveyor referred to the DEM, the correlation in accuracy values
              is not guaranteed. But, this method can provide a preliminary
              indication of accuracy, particularly if the independent field
              survey points with known accuracy are already available from
              another source;</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>POINT vs POINT: Independent field surveys of selected
              quality check points can be compared to the individual aerial
              data elevation points. The selected check points must exactly
              match the coordinates of the aerial data points to ensure that a
              valid comparison is being made. To do this, the aerial survey
              must first be received in order to select the points at which
              comparison will be made, which may slow the data collection
              phase. Alternatively, early liaison with the aerial surveyor may
              allow the location of a number of points to be known before data
              provision, which may save time; and</para>

              <para>STRING vs DTM SURFACE: A more appropriate approach may be
              to field survey a number of breakline strings along key linear
              features. These strings may be some 50 m - 200 m in length with
              points at regular spacing (say every 5 -15 m). A comparison can
              then be made of the profiles along the feature determined from
              both the aerial and field survey. In addition, if the strings
              are across conveyance paths (i.e. they are cross-sections), the
              modeller can check that conveyance cross-sectional areas are
              adequately represented. These comparisons enable a qualitative
              assessment of aerial survey accuracy for a given region within
              the study area. A number of surveyed strings may be required
              across the study area to gain an overall appreciation of

        <title>Bathymetric (Underwater) Techniques</title>

        <para>Many methods for generating surface data are not applicable to
        collecting bathymetric data (ground data below the water surface) in
        permanent or semi permanent water bodies. Where a water body has not
        been surveyed adequately previously, a specific survey will be
        required to supplement the ground surface data.</para>

        <para>If the water body is shallow or small then a traditional surface
        survey technique may be suitable. For deeper, larger water bodies, a
        specialised bathymetric survey may be required. Instruments such as
        echo sounders, side scan sonar systems and acoustic doppler profilers
        may be used for this purpose.</para>

        <para>In most cases, the bathymetric survey will need to be merged
        with ground surface data.</para>

        <para>While bathymetric surveys have been conducted for most major
        rivers, if the data is not recent and the riverbed is subject to
        change then the data should not be checked for suitability prior to

      <section>
        <title>Aerial Photographs</title>

        <para>Aerial photographs are an important source of qualitative data
        and can be collected during an aerial survey. Geo-referenced (or
        ortho-rectified) aerial photos can be supplied as part of a
        photogrammetric survey. These geo-referenced aerial photographs are
        aerial photos where spatial coordinates have been added to locate the
        photograph. It is important to recognise that the raw aerial
        photograph is spatially distorted, being a planar image of a curved
        surface of variable height. In ortho-rectifying the image, the image
        is scaled, rotated and stretched so that various reference locations
        move to their correct coordinate locations.</para>

        <para>A consequence of this is the location of features on an aerial
        photograph will have a degree of uncertainty. For example, if a
        rectified aerial photograph is used to locate a flood mark, the
        attributed location will be subject to a tolerance. In an area of high
        flood gradient this can result in differences between observed and
        simulated flood levels that do not accurately represent the true
        differences.</para>

        <para>Aerial photographs, while not providing quantitative data
        directly, can provide additional information about flowpaths, flow
        obstacles and floodplain vegetation that is not always immediately
        evident or accessible on a site inspection. Additionally, aerial
        photos can be a useful guide when defining parameters for floodplain
        characteristics (for example, roughness coefficients) and can be used
        to develop a spatial map of the floodplain parameter.</para>

        <para>Another example of the use of aerial photography is its use in
        urban areas to define building outlines or fence lines where these are
        to be included within the hydraulic model and can be a reasonable
        source of information for assessing the total imperviousness of a
        catchment (see Book 5, Chapter ? Cross reference to Losses).</para>

        <para>Finally, when historical aerial photography is available, it is
        useful in assessing catchment development or sourcing information on
        the floodplain development when historical events occurred.</para>

        <title>Historical Topography and Infrastructure</title>

        <para>All data collection methods covered thus far have been concerned
        with present day catchment conditions. However, when catchment
        modelling systems are used for design flood estimation, calibration to
        historical events is required and the catchment and floodplain
        conditions at the time of the historical event need to be considered
        particularly as these conditions may not be the same as present day
        conditions. In addition, if a number of events are to be used during
        the calibration process, changes to catchment conditions may occur
        between events.</para>

        <para>Conditions at each of the relevant historical points in time
        must be established and used in the model development; this is
        discussed in more detail in <xref linkend="book7"/>. Changes to
        conditions that may affect flood behaviour include dam construction,
        initial dam storage levels, dredging or siltation of river channels
        and particularly of river mouths, construction of levees and other
        associated flood mitigation works, road construction including the
        raising or duplication of roads, the realignment of road embankments,
        the construction of new culverts and/or bridges, upgraded drainage
        networks both in rural and urban environments, developments on the
        floodplain, the construction of new weirs or the removal of old weirs,
        different crop types or stage in the growing season, and others that
        have not been mentioned here. Depending upon the length of time since
        the occurrence of the calibration event, record of these changes may
        be only available anecdotally.</para>

        <para>The availability of data for historical events needs to be
        considered when the event is used as part of the design flood
        estimation. For example, there may be anecdotal or even good formal
        measurement evidence of a record flood that occurred 100 years ago but
        details of this flood event may not be adequate for its use as a
        calibration event for validation of a catchment modelling system. On
        the other hand, the data may be adequate for it to be included as a
        high discharge censored event in a flood frequency analysis (<xref

        <title>Tidal Data</title>

        <para>In many coastal areas and areas adjacent to coasts, ocean and
        tidal data can be an important component of the design flood
        estimation process. Tidal data may be collected by manual observations
        or by automatic recorders and needs to include astronomical tides as
        well as storm surge and long term trends in sea levels. In some
        circumstances, wave data may also be relevant.</para>

        <para>Historical tidal data for particular events can be useful model
        calibration while long term records can be used for statistical
        analysis for design flood estimation purposes (see <xref
        linkend="b6_ch5"/>). With increased sea levels induced by global
        warming, long term records of tides and sea levels need to be checked
        for stationarity; see <emphasis role="bold">cross reference to Bryson
        </emphasis>for a discussion of climate change data.</para>

        <para>Tidal data is collected routinely by relevant government
        agencies, with a concern for the coastal environment or engineering
        and this data is published in handbooks or websites. In addition,
        there are research or other short term projects carried out in coastal
        areas and these may include data on tides. However, these projects
        generally are localised and of short duration.</para>
      </section>

      <section>
        <title>Soil Data</title>

        <para>Some hydrologic models require information on the catchment soil
        properties (for example, information on the A and B horizon depths and
        their water holding capacity, or the soil type) to estimate losses
        from the rainfall.</para>

        <para>Soil property data is available spatially for the whole country
        from the Atlas of Australian Soils (<emphasis role="bold">reference
        required</emphasis>); this information is available in shapefile
        (<emphasis role="bold">reference required to format</emphasis>) format
        from the Australian Soil Resource Information System website. These
        maps are broad scale (typically 1:250000 - 1:500000) and were
        completed between 1960 and 1968. State based maps are available, also.
        Care should be taken when using soil maps as variations in soil over
        short distances occur frequently and cannot be resolved by the
        reconnaissance style mapping used in their development (Mckenzie et
        al., 2000).</para>

        <para>While it is possible to estimate land subject to inundation by
        floods through consideration of the soils and geomorphology, this does
        not provide any guidance on the likelihood of the flood hazard and
        therefore can be misleading. Furthermore, there is a need to ensure
        that the soil and geomorphoric data is obtained at a fine scale to
        ensure spatial variations over short distances are adequately
        recognised.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Property Data</title>

        <para>In order to assess the magnitude of the flood hazard to people
        and property, property data (including building type, condition and
        floor level) typically are required.</para>

        <para>Property databases form the basis of most flood damage
        assessments. These databases typically require a description of the
        property attributes and features on a property by property basis.
        Typical information required for each residential property
        includes:</para>

        information, but also require information on the type of business
        undertaken at the site as this can have a significant bearing on the
        value of flood damages from business to business.</para>

        <para>Ideally, this data are collected via field survey. However, it
        can be a costly process depending upon the number of properties for
        which data are required. Alternatively, there may sometimes be records
        available from the local authority, other government agency or the
        census. For broad assessments, property data may be estimated. A panel
        of people with relevant skills should review the method of estimation
        for soundness. As an example, property data may be estimated from
        aerial photography or from a general understanding of local

    <section>
      <title>Introduction to Streamflow Records</title>

      <para>Streamflow records are the basic data source used in developing
      reliable surface water resources because the records provide data on the
      availability of streamflow and its variability in time and space. The
      records, therefore, are used in the planning and design of surface water
      related projects, and also they are used in the management or operation
      of the projects after construction of the projects has been
      completed.</para>

      <para>In addition, streamflow records are used for calibrating catchment
      modelling systems which, for example, are used for predicting flood
      behaviour and for predicting hazards arising from design flood events.
      Records of flood events obtained at gauging stations also serve as one
      of the basic data sources for design flood estimation necessary for the
      design of bridges, culverts, dams and flood control reservoirs, flood
      plain delineation and flood warning systems; and in the development of
      methods applicable to locations where data is not available.</para>

      <para>It is essential, to have valid records for a full range of
      streamflows. The streamflow records referred to above primarily are
      continuous records of discharge at stream-gauging stations; a gauging
      station being a site instrumented and operated so that a continuous
      record of stage and discharge can be obtained. A network of continuous
      recording gauging stations, however, often is augmented by auxiliary
      networks of partial record stations to fill a particular need for
      streamflow data at a relatively low cost. For example, an auxiliary
      network of sites, instrumented and operated to provide only
      instantaneous peak level data, is often established.</para>

      <title>General Stream Gauging Procedures</title>

      <section>
        <title>Introduction</title>

        <para>When a need for streamflow records at a site is recognised, a
        gauging station will be installed. This gauging station will comprise
        instruments for the measure of the river stage and a location selected
        to take advantage of the best locally available conditions for stage
        and discharge measurement and for developing a stable stage-discharge
        relationship, sometimes referred to as a rating curve. While there are
        instruments available that simultaneously monitor river stage and
        discharge, the more common instrumentation requires the use of a
        stage-discharge relationship to convert the monitored river stage into
        an equivalent river discharge rate. Artificial controls such as low
        weirs or flumes are constructed at some stations to stabilize the
        stage-discharge relationships in the low discharge range. These
        control structures are calibrated by stage and discharge measurements
        in the field.</para>

        <para>Selection of the gauging station site and the development of the
        stage-discharge relationship are important components in the
        management of a gauging station and hence the discussion herein will
        focus on these aspects of management of a gauging station. While there
        are many other aspects important in the management of a gauging
        station, these two aspects have the most significant impact on
        prediction of design flood characteristics.</para>

        is a need to determine a location for the gauging station. There are
        numerous guides on site selection with the aim of these guides on
        ensuring the data is reliable (<emphasis
        role="bold">references</emphasis>). Criteria suggested by ISO (1995)
        for an ideal gauging station site are:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>The general course of the stream is straight for about 10
            times the stream width, upstream and downstream from the gauging
            station site if the control is a river reach (channel control). If
            the control is a section control, the downstream conditions must
            be such that the control is not drowned. The water entering a
            section control should have low velocity;</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>The total discharge is confined to one channel at all stages
            and no discharge bypasses the site as subsurface flow or in
            anabranches activated during flood events. Where flood discharges
            by-pass the site of the gauging station and no alternative site
            exists, consideration should be given to gauging the by-pass
            routes;</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>The stream-bed is not subject to scour and fill and is
            relatively free of aquatic vegetation;</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Banks are permanent, high enough to contain floods, and are
            free of brush;</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>A pool is present upstream from the control at extremely low
            stages to ensure a recording of stage at extremely low discharge,
            and to avoid high velocities at the stream end of stage recorder
            intakes, transducers, or manometer orifice during periods of high
            discharge. The sensitivity of the control should be such that any
            significant change in discharge shall result in a measurable
            change in stage. Also, the pool volume should not be a significant
            proportion of the flood hydrograph volume thereby limiting the
            attenuation effects of the gauging station. This point is very
            important for the gauging of urban catchments which tend to be
            small and fast responding;</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>The gauging station site is far enough upstream from the
            confluence with another stream or from tidal effect to avoid any
            variable influence the other stream or the tide may have on the
            stage at the gauging station site;</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>The site is readily accessible for ease in installation and
            operation of the gauging station;</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>Good conditions for discharge measurements at all

          <listitem>
            <para>Instruments, shelter, and housing are above all flood

            measure both high and low discharge conditions.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>However, it is rare to find the ideal site for a gauging
        station. It is more common that the limitations of a site must be
        considered with respect to the desired data from the site.</para>

        <title>Data Collected at a Gauging Station</title>

        <para>There are many different approaches to collection of data at a
        stream gauging station. As stated previously, the purpose of a gauging
        station is to collect data about the time history of discharge at that
        point in the catchment drainage network. In general, the data
        collected consists of the gauge heights, sometimes referred to as
        stages. These gauge heights are used as the independent variable in a
        stage-discharge relationship to estimate the discharge at that point
        in time. Reliability of the discharge record is dependent on the
        accuracy and precision of the gauge-height record as well as the
        accuracy and precision of the stage-discharge relationship.</para>

        <para>Gauge-height records may be obtained by systematic observation
        of a non-recording gauge, or with automatic water level sensors and
        recorders. Furthermore, various types of transmitting systems are used
        to relay gauge-height information from remote gauging stations to
        storage databases.</para>

        <para>New technology, especially in the field of electronics and
        computer based management of field data, has led to a number of
        innovations in sensing, recording, and transmitting gauge height data.
        In the past the majority of gauging stations used floats in stilling
        wells as the primary method of sensing gauge height. Floats and
        stilling wells are still in common use today. However, the current
        trend is toward the use of submersible or non-submersible pressure
        transducers which do not require a stilling well. Additionally,
        electronic data recorders and various transmission systems are being
        used more extensively.</para>

        <para>Details of the instruments and associated structures for a
        stream gauging station are outlined by ISO (1983), Rantz (1982), and
        WMO (2010) and hence are not repeated herein. Nonetheless, users of
        stream discharge data for design flood estimation should ensure that
        they are conversant with the instruments and structures employed for
        the collection of streamflow data.</para>

        <title>Stage-Discharge Relationships</title>

        <para>The conversion of a record of gauge-height to a record of
        discharge is through use of a stage-discharge relationship. The
        physical element or combination of elements that maintains the
        relation is known as a control. One major classification of controls
        differentiates between section controls and channel controls. Another
        classification differentiates between natural and artificial controls.
        Artificial controls are structures built for the specific purpose of
        controlling the stage-discharge relation, such as a weir, flume, or
        small dam. A third classification differentiates between complete,
        partial and compound controls.</para>

        <para>The two attributes of a satisfactory control are stability and
        sensitivity. If the control is stable the stage-discharge relationship
        will be stable. If the control is subject to change, the
        stage-discharge relationship will be subject to change and frequent
        discharge measurements will be required for the continual
        re-calibration of the stage-discharge relationship. This increases the
        operating cost of the gauging station and also increases the
        uncertainty of streamflow records extracted from the database.
        Additional data about controls can be found in Herschy (1995).</para>

        <para>The traditional way in which a stage discharge relationship is
        derived for a particular gauging station is the measurement of
        discharge at convenient times. Traditionally, this measurement is
        undertaken with a current meter measuring the discharge velocity at
        enough points over the river cross section so that the discharge rate
        can be obtained for that particular stage. By taking such measurements
        for a number of different stages and corresponding discharges over a
        period of time, a number of points can be plotted on a stage-discharge
        diagram, and a curve drawn through those points, giving what is hoped
        to be a unique relationship between stage and discharge, the stage
        discharge relationship, as shown in Figure 1..10. This rating curve is
        used in a manner whereby the routinely measured stages are converted
        to discharges by assuming that the corresponding discharge can be
        obtained from the curve.</para>

          </mediaobject>
        </figure>

        <para>There are a number of factors which might cause the rating curve
        not to give the actual discharge, some of which will vary with time.
        Fenton (2001) quotes Boyer (1964) as describing a list of factors
        affecting the rating curve, or what he called a <emphasis>shifting
        control</emphasis>. These include:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>The channel changing as a result of modification due to
            dredging, bridge construction, or vegetation growth;</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Sediment transport - where the bed is in motion, which can
            have an effect over a single flood event, because the effective
            bed roughness can change during the event. As a flood increases,
            any bed forms present will tend to become larger and increase the
            effective roughness, so that friction is greater after the flood
            peak than before, so that the corresponding discharge for a given
            stage height will be less after the peak. This will also
            contribute to a flood event showing a looped curve on a stage
            discharge diagram as shown on Figure 1..11. Both Simons and
            Richardson (1962) and Fenton and Keller (2001) have examined this
            phenomenon and presented approaches for dealing with this
            issue;</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Backwater effects - changes in the conditions downstream
            such as the construction of a dam or flooding in the next waterway
            downstream;</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Unsteadiness - in general the discharge will change rapidly
            during a flood, and the slope of the water surface will be
            different from that for a constant stage, depending on whether the
            discharge is increasing or decreasing. The effect of this is for
            the trajectory of a flood event to appear as a loop on a
            stage-discharge diagram as shown in Figure 1..11;</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Variable channel storage - where the stream overflows onto
            floodplains during high discharges, giving rise to different
            slopes and to unsteadiness effects; and</para>

        <para>In addition to these generic problems associated with the use of
        rating curves, there are several problems associated with the use of
        rating curves for prediction of a design flood characteristic. These
        include:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>The assumption of a unique relationship between stage and
            discharge, in general, is not justified;</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Discharge is rarely measured during a flood, and the quality
            of data at the high discharge end of the curve typically is quite
            poor. As a result estimation of the peak discharge of a flood
            event usually involves extrapolation of the stage-discharge
            relationship beyond the recorded data points;</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>The relationship is usually a line of best fit through the
            data points defining the stage-discharge relationship. The
            approach recommended for estimation of this line of best fit in
            many guidance documents (see, for example, WMO 2010) is a visual
            fit. This approach provides minimal data on the uncertainty of the
            relationship and the reliability of any extrapolation of the
            relationship. This limits the estimation of the propagation of the
            uncertainty in the flood characteristic prediction approach;
            and</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>It has to describe a range of variation from no discharge
            through small but typical discharges to very large extreme flood
            events.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>As highlighted in the previous discussion, the unsteadiness of
        the discharge during a flood event (i.e. the variation of discharge
        with time) and its influence on a discharge estimate is ignored in the
        traditional application of a rating curve. In a flood event the slope
        of the water surface for a given stage will be different from that for
        the same stage during steady flow conditions; this difference will
        depend on whether the discharge is increasing or decreasing. As the
        flood increases, the surface slope in the river is greater than the
        slope for steady flow at the same stage, and hence, according to
        conventional hydraulic theory more water is flowing down the river
        than the rating curve would suggest. The effect of this is shown in
        Figure 1..11. When the water level is falling, the slope and, hence,
        the discharge inferred is less. The effects of this might be important
        - the peak discharge could be significantly underestimated during
        highly dynamic floods, and also since the maximum discharge and
        maximum stage do not coincide, the arrival time of the peak discharge
        could be in error and may influence flood warning predictions.
        Finally, the use of a discharge hydrograph derived inaccurately by
        using a single-valued rating relationship may distort estimates for
        resistance coefficients during calibration of an unsteady flow
        model.</para>

        <para>It might be expected by practitioners that good instructions and
        guidance would be provided by the International and Australian
        Standards (AS3778.2.3-2001), which are the same, the latter being a
        reproduction of the former. Another source of guidance is provided by
        WMO (2010). However, Fenton and Keller (2001) state:</para>

        <para><emphasis>“the Standards seem confusing and poorly prepared. In
        many places they state the obvious, but where sophisticated or modern
        methods are required, they have almost no serious guidance for
        practical implementation.”.</emphasis></para>

        <para>Despite these issues, stage-discharge relationships form a
        foundation for the generation of the data necessary for the prediction
        of design flood characteristics.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Extrapolation of Stage-Discharge Relationships</title>

        <para>The stage-discharge relationship can be considered to consist of
        two zones; these zones are:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>An interpolation zone where the relationship is within the
            range of the stage measurements used to develop the relationship;
            and</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>An extrapolation zone where the relationship is not defined
            by gaugings taken to develop the relationship.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>A diagrammatic illustration of these two zones is shown in
        Figure 1..12.</para>

        <figure>
          <title>Stage-Discharge Relationship Zones</title>

          <mediaobject>

            </imageobject>
          </mediaobject>
        </figure>

        <para>While it is preferable that all stage measurements are within
        the interpolation zone, the nature of the data needed for design flood
        estimation, and for flood prediction in general, the reliability of
        data from measurements within the extrapolation zone will require
        consideration of the extrapolation methodology. The need for
        extrapolation is shown in Figure 1..13 where the discharges for the
        Annual Maxima Series extracted for Stream Gauge 222202 are plotted as
        a function of the rating ratio (the rating ratio is the ratio of the
        recorded discharge to the highest gauging used to develop the
        stage-discharge relationship). All points in the Annual Maxima Series
        where the rating ratio is greater than 1 require use of the
        extrapolation zone of the stage-discharge relationship.</para>

        <para><figure>
            <title>Annual Maximum Series for Gauge 222202</title>

              </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>
          </figure>As shown in Figure 1..13, a number of the values in the
        Annual Maxima Series are in the extrapolation zone. The accuracy of
        the values in the extrapolation zone has the potential to influence
        fitting of the statistical model to the Annual Maxima Series, thereby
        influencing the predicted design flood quantiles. Fitting a
        statistical model to data points where the higher values are subject
        to estimate errors is discussed in <xref linkend="b3_ch2"/>.</para>

        <para>There are a number of alternative techniques for development of
        the extrapolation zone of the stage-discharge relationship. The
        guidance provided by the International and Australian Standards is
        limited; a recommendation that a logarithmic extrapolation be used is
        included in the guidance. However, there is a recognition that
        extrapolation using logarithmic techniques needs to be confirmed
        through investigation of the station conditions.</para>

        <para>An alternative approach that has developed since development of
        computer based modelling systems is the use of a hydraulic model to
        develop the extrapolation zone of the stage-discharge relationship.
        Similar to the application of a logarithmic technique, the suitability
        of this approach needs to be confirmed prior to its application. Of
        particular concern is the modelling of the energy losses associated
        with flow in the channel and adjacent floodplains where it is
        necessary to assume that the parameter values obtained during
        calibration are suitable for the larger discharges being simulated in
        the extrapolation zone of the stage-discharge relationship.</para>

        <para>The important point in this discussion, however, is a
        recognition that the values of the data extracted from a discharge
        record for fitting of a statistical model will contain values where
        the conversion of the recorded level to an equivalent discharge
        occurred through extrapolation of the stage-discharge relationship.
        Consideration of this in the fitting of a statistical model to the
        Annual Maxima Series is discussed later in <xref
        linkend="b3_ch2"/>.</para>

      <section>
        <title>Uncertainty of Discharge Measurements</title>

        <para>The accuracy, or uncertainty, of a discharge measurement is very
        important for purposes of assessing the quality and reliability of
        that measurement. The concept of error and error analysis is a
        long-standing practice in the field of hydraulics and hydrology. The
        concept of uncertainty, however, is relatively new. Nonetheless,
        methods for evaluating, defining and expressing the uncertainty of
        streamflow measurements have developed.</para>

        <para>Uncertainty and accuracy are terms that are sometimes used
        interchangeably even though they have two very distinct meanings.
        Accuracy (or error) refers to the agreement, or disagreement, between
        the measurement of stream discharge and the true or correct value of
        the discharge at the time of measurement. Because we can never know
        the true value of the discharge we can never know the exact amount of
        error in the discharge measurement.</para>

        <para>The uncertainty of a discharge measurement, on the other hand,
        acknowledges that no measurement is perfect. It is defined, therefore,
        as a parameter associated with the result of a measurement that
        characterizes the dispersion of values that could reasonably be
        attributed to the measurement. It is typically expressed as a range of
        values in which the measurement value is estimated to lie, within a
        given statistical confidence. It does not attempt to define or rely on
        a unique true value. In summary, common usage of the word accuracy for
        quantitatively describing the characteristics of a discharge
        measurement is incompatible with its correct meaning. The proper term
        for expressing the statistical confidence of possible values for a
        discharge measurement is uncertainty.</para>

        <para>The sources of uncertainty in discharge mesaurements can be
        categorised as</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Measurement - these are the uncertainties associated with
            taking the measurements. The primary component in this category is
            instrument accuracy; accuracy of both the velocity meter and the
            level recorder need to be considered.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Methodology - these are the uncertainties associated with
            the analysis of the recorded measurements to enable the
            development of a point on the stage-discharge relationship. In
            this category, features such as the assumption of linear variation
            in the cross section between the bathymetric points, the
            assumption of a logarithmic vertical velocity profile, wind
            effects, changing stage during measurement, etc need to be
            considered.</para>
