    <title>Alternative Approaches</title>

    <para>The first section of this chapter needs to introduce the conceptual
    model of design flood estimation techniques - this will be an expansion of
    the initial sections of the IAHR paper on revisiting the design flood
    problem. Included in this section therefore is the presentation of the
    design flood problem as a data mining problem (i.e. a hydroinformatic
    problem) where a statistical model is fitted to relevant data; this data
    can be the result of field monitoring, regional regression, or catchment
    simulation. This needs to be carefully framed as it forms the foundation
    of the approach being adopted in later sections.</para>
