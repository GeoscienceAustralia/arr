    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>There is now widespread acceptance that human activities are
    contributing to observed climate change. Human-induced climate change has
    the potential to alter the prevalence and severity of rainfall extremes,
    storm surge and floods. Recognition of the risks associated with climate
    change is required for better planning of new infrastructure and
    mitigating potential damage to existing infrastructure.</para>

    <para>There are five aspects of design flood estimation that are likely to be impacted by
      climate change: rainfall intensity-frequency-duration (IFD) relationships; rainfall temporal
      patterns; continuous rainfall sequences; antecedent conditions and baseflow regimes; and
      compound extremes (eg riverine flooding combined with storm surge). The magnitudes of the
      impacts on any these areas have not been subjected to comprehensive study either nationally or
      internationally. </para>
    <para>In the case of heavy rainfall, the climate change projections released in 2015 show
      simulated increases in the magnitude of the wettest annual daily total and the 1 in 20 year
      wettest daily total across Australia (CSIRO and Bureau of Meteorology, 2015). The projections
      do not include information about potential changes in rainfall IFD relationships and rainfall
      temporal patterns. Quite restricted sets of climate change projections for the Greater Sydney
      and southeast Queensland regions indicate that rainfall IFD relationships are sensitive to
      climate change (Bates et al., 2015). For example, the projections for Greater Sydney suggest
      that the 1% annual exceedance probability (AEP) for the 24 hour duration event will increase
      by up to 20% by 2050. To the west, in some parts of the Blue Mountains and beyond, decreases
      are possible. These projections are not definitive, however, since only one high-end
      greenhouse gas emissions scenario and a small set of climate model results were considered.
      For present climatic conditions, the analysis of Wasko and Sharma (2015) indicates that
      temporal patterns of rainfall intensity within storm bursts in Australia are impacted by
      temperature variations regardless of the climatic region and season. For the Greater Sydney
      region, Zheng et al. (2015) found differing trends in annual maximum rainfall for different
      durations.</para>

    <para>This Interim Guideline for Climate Change provides designers and
    decision makers with an approach to address the risks from climate change
    in projects and decisions that involve estimation of design flood
    characteristics while further research is undertaken to reduce key
    uncertainties. It draws on the most recent climate science, particularly
    the release of the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC, 2013) as well as
    the new climate change projections for Australia (CSIRO and Bureau of
    Meteorology, 2015). As such, the Guideline is focused on potential changes
    in rainfall intensity (or equivalent depth) given the paucity of climate
    change projections for other factors that influence flood risk.</para>

    <para>For consistency with design rainfall IFD estimates (Book 2), the
    Guideline is intended to be applied to the key system design event (ie the
    design standard for the structure or infrastructure). It is applicable for
    current-day rainfall intensities within the range of probability of one
    exceedance per year and annual exceedance probabilities from 50% to 1%.
    The approach described below considers regional risks from climate change,
    the service life (ie the total period during which an asset remains in
    use) or the planning horizon of the decision (ie the length of time that a
    plan looks into the future), the social acceptability and other
    consequences of failure, and the cost of retrofits. If climate change is
    found to be a significant issue for the facility of interest through a
    screening analysis, a more detailed analysis is needed to draw on the best
    available knowledge of the likely future climate and to allow for changes
    in the intensity of heavy rainfall events over time.</para>

    <para>As the science of climate change is continually changing, it is
    anticipated that the Interim Guideline will be replaced gradually as new
    and detailed research findings are released. The latest published sources
    should always be sought for use in future assessments and decision making.
    The Guideline does not replace the need for informed judgement of likely
    risks, or the need for detailed local analysis (for example through the
    use of additional climate and hydrological modelling) where the facilities
    under consideration are important and the risks potentially large.</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Climate Futures Web Tool</title>

    <para>The Guideline uses output from the Climate Futures web tool developed by the CSIRO.
      Climate change projections are focussed on Natural Resource Management (NRM) ‘clusters’
      (Figure 1). Projected changes from global climate models (GCMs) can be explored for 14 20-year
      periods and the four representative concentration pathways (RCPs) for greenhouse gas and
      aerosol concentrations that were used to drive the GCMs. The RCPs are designated as 2.6, 4.5,
      6.0 and 8.5, and are named according to radiative forcing values (W m-2) in the year 2100
      relative to pre-industrial values. Use of RCPs 4.5 and 8.5 (low and high concentrations,
      respectively) is recommended for impact assessment. Further details can be found at the
      Australian Climate Futures Website<footnote>
        <para><link
            xlink:href="http://www.climatechangeinaustralia.gov.au/en/climate-projections/climate-futures-tool/introduction-climate-futures/"
            >http://www.climatechangeinaustralia.gov.au/en/climate-projections/climate-futures-tool/introduction-climate-futures/</link></para>
      </footnote>.</para>

    <para>Climate Futures subdivides the projected changes in two climate variables (such as
      temperature and rainfall) from the full suite of GCMs into several classes, eg warmer-wetter,
      hotter-drier, much hotter-much drier. The changes are relative to a 20-year (1986-2005)
      baseline. The resultant classification provides a visual display of the spread and clustering
      of the projected changes. This provides model consensus information for each class and assists
      the selection of the classes that are of most importance for impact assessment.</para>

    <para>Generally, there is more confidence in GCM simulations of temperature than for rainfall.
      Thus the Guideline provides an adjustment factor for design rainfall IFD curves informed by
      temperature projections alone. These temperature projections are then combined with current
      understanding of changes to extreme rainfall event intensities based on research in Australia
      and overseas. This research includes observation-based assessments, physical arguments on the
      water holding capacity of a warmer atmosphere and high resolution dynamical downscaling
      experiments. Using these multiple lines of evidence the expected change in heavy rainfalls is
      between 2% and 15% per °C of warming.</para>

    </figure>

    <para>Given the uncertainty in rainfall projections and their considerable
    regional variability, an increase in rainfall (intensity or depth) of 5%
    per °C of local warming is recommended.</para>

    <para>The proposed rate of increase has been tempered because: there is no
    guarantee that the same scaling will apply across all of the frequencies
    and durations typically considered in flood design, and there are other
    factors that have the potential to affect future rainfall intensities (or
    depths) over land. These include changes in regional atmospheric
    circulation, synoptic systems and soil wetness.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Interim Climate Change Guideline</title>

    <para>Risk is the combination of hazard and exposure. Failure to account for potential  climate
      hazards can lead to poor decisions, particularly when the exposure risk to climate change is
      medium to high. In these circumstances, a reasonable approach is to make a decision that is
      robust against a range of plausible futures. These futures can be obtained from the Climate
      Futures web tool. Where exposure to climate change and the consequences of failure of the
      asset of interest are high, more detailed local studies including the use of downscaling
      methods are recommended. This approach ensures a balance between standardising practice and
      allowing for the use of informed professional judgement.</para>

    <para>For consistency with the design rainfall IFD estimates in Book 2,
    the Guideline is intended to be applied to the key system design event (ie
    the design standard for the structure or infrastructure). It is applicable
    for rainfall intensities under the current climatic regime within the
    range of probability of one exceedance per year and annual exceedance
    probabilities (AEPs) from 50% to 1%. Other mechanisms that affect the
    magnitude of flooding, such as tailwater levels and oceanic processes (eg
    wind, waves and tides) are not considered. Where there is an additional
    risk of coastal flooding from sea level rise refer to Engineers
    Australia’s (2013) for guidance.</para>

    <para>A six-step process is used to incorporate climate change risks into
    decisions involving the estimation of design flood characteristics. The
    process uses a decision tree approach that enables the practitioner to
    define the nature of the information needed for a particular problem and
    to reach an appropriate course of action (see Figures 2 to 4 or Appendix
    1).</para>

    <section>
      <title>Step 1 – Set the Service Life or Planning Horizon</title>

      <para>The first consideration is the service life of an asset or
      planning horizon of an activity (Figure 2). This underpins the design
      philosophy and may fundamentally control the selection of material,
      methods and expertise. In current practice, a broad perspective on
      service life may be required incorporating engineering, client and
      community perspectives. Potential climate change considerations may
      influence these decisions, particularly as the risks from climate change
      are likely to increase over time.</para>

      <figure>
        <title>Decision Tree for Incorporating Climate Change in Flood Design
        – Part 1 of 3 (AEP = Annual Exceedance Probability; PMF = Probable
        Maximum Flood; ARR Book 2 = Design Rainfall Intensity (or Equivalent
        Depth) for Current-Climate Conditions).</title>

        <mediaobject>
          <imageobject>
            <imagedata fileref="../../figures/1033.jpg"/>
          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>If the service life or planning horizon is relatively short (less than 20 years from
        2015) climate change will have negligible impact on rainfall IFD characteristics over that
        period of time. Thus the projected hazard will be similar to the present, and the design
        process should be based on the design rainfall IFD and temporal patterns described in Book
        2. Otherwise, proceed to Step 2.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Step 2 – Set the Flood Design Standard</title>

      <para>Again consider Figure 2. If the design standard is the Probable
      Maximum Flood (PMF), use an up-to-date estimate of the Probable Maximum
      Precipitation (PMP) to determine the PMF. This approach has an
      appropriate degree of conservatism as PMP estimates are updated by the
      Bureau of Meteorology from time to time. This will ensure that any
      future climate change signal is captured and thus the PMP should not be
      further adjusted to take into account potential climate change
      implications. Otherwise, proceed to Step 3.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Step 3 – Consider the Purpose and Nature of the Asset or Activity
      and Consequences of its Failure</title>

      <para>Consider Figure 3. Here ‘purpose of the asset’ can refer to flow
      conveyance, improved safety, and reduced frequency of exposure and
      damage. Flood-related design requirements (eg minimum fill levels and
      minimum floor levels) need to be considered, as well as the consequences
      of failure (eg risks to life, property and the environment) and the cost
      of retrofitting assets if design rainfall IFD characteristics change
      with time.</para>

        Consequences of Failure; COR = Cost of Retrofits; ARR Book 2 = Design
        Rainfall Intensity (or Equivalent Depth) for Current-Climate
        Conditions).</title>

      </figure>
      <para>The impact of the possible failure of the facility (eg asset, process or management
        strategy) will have direct and indirect consequences, and should be assessed in terms of
        primary risk outcomes such as issues of cost, safety, social acceptability and environmental
        impact. Some categorisation of facilities may be useful when determining the consequences of
        failure. For example, there can be substantial consequences if assets related to the
        delivery of essential services fail or are significantly impacted.</para>

      <para>The consequences of failure can be rated as either low, medium or
      high:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Low consequence: some probability that asset performance will be impacted but the
            delivery of services will be only partially or temporarily compromised, or alternative
            sources of services (eg availability of different power sources) are readily
            available.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Medium consequence: moderate to large probability that performance of important but
            non-critical assets and delivery of services will be impacted or fail for a short period
            of time.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>High consequence: moderate to large probability that performance will be impacted or
            fail, leading to disruption to delivery of essential services (where alternative sources
            of services are not readily available). This category generally relates to high value
            assets, or assets of significant economic or welfare importance.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Where the consequences of failure and the costs of retrofitting are considered to be
        low, the project or decision should proceed in accordance with the original design
        specifications. Otherwise, proceed to Step 4.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Step 4 – Carry out a Climate Change Risk Screening
      Analysis</title>

      <para>Again consider Figure 3. Step 4 responds to the question: Is
      climate change a significant issue for the facility of interest? Here
      the risks of climate change are assessed with regard to their capacity
      to impair the facility’s ability to perform its intended function. The
      description of impact or failure involves the use of heavy rainfall
      events with different AEPs. This task can be facilitated by use of the
      AEPs listed in Table 1. Recall that the scope of this Interim Guideline
      is limited to design AEPs more frequent than the 1% event. If the design
      AEP corresponds to the <emphasis
      role="italic">i</emphasis><superscript>th</superscript> row in Table 1,
      consider the impact of the AEP events corresponding to the (<emphasis
      role="italic">i</emphasis>+1)<superscript>th</superscript> and
      (<emphasis role="italic">i</emphasis>+2)<superscript>th</superscript>
      rows on the facility of interest and the associated consequences. For
      example, if the design AEP is 1% an analyst could consider the impact of
      the 0.5% and 0.2% AEP events.</para>

      <para>The outputs from this step include a good understanding of the
      extent to which the risks of climate change may exceed the coping
      capacity of the facility to perform its intended function. If the
      incremental impact and consequences are low (eg increases in flood
      levels are slight) then the exposure risk to climate change is low, and
      design rainfall should be determined using Book 2. Otherwise, proceed to
      Step 5.</para>

      <title>Step 5 – Consider Climate Change Projections and their
      Consequences</title>

      <para>Consider Figure 4. At this point the consequences of impact on
      performance and exposure risk to climate change have been judged to be
      medium or high. Hence consideration needs to be given to whether the
      original design specifications of the project or the decision need to be
      reviewed and adjusted. This necessitates the use of climate change
      projections. The selection of projections or scenarios is an important
      source of uncertainty in the use of GCM outputs.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">In reaching Step 5, the minimum basis for design should be the low
          greenhouse gas and aerosol concentration pathway RCP4.5 and the maximum GCM consensus case
          indicated by the Climate Futures web tool for the NRM cluster of interest (Section
          4).</emphasis> The choice of RCP4.5 is recommended because RCP2.6 requires ambitious
        global emissions reductions. The maximum consensus case is a reasonable choice since it is
        not unduly affected by outlying GCM results. <emphasis role="bold">Where the additional
          expense can be justified on socioeconomic and environmental grounds, the maximum consensus
          case for the high concentration pathway RCP8.5 should also be
        considered</emphasis>.</para>

      <para>Appendix 2 contains a summary of relevant information provided the Climate Futures web
        tool. For each NRM cluster (Figure 1), the GCM consensus cases are listed for four class
        intervals (ranges) of projected annual mean surface temperature increases for RCPs 4.5 and
        8.5 relative to the 1986 – 2005 baseline. The class intervals are ‘slightly warmer’ (&lt;
        0.5 °C), ‘warmer’ (0.5 to 1.5 °C), ‘hotter’ (1.5 to 3 °C) and ‘much hotter’ (&gt; 3 °C). As
        the upper class interval is open-ended, median temperature increases (in parentheses) are
        given for cases containing one of more GCMs. Generally, the median temperature increase for
        the ‘much hotter’ class interval increases with increasing service life or planning horizon.
        This is not the case for the Monsoonal North cluster where the median increase for RCP8.5
        and 2090 is 0.1 °C less than that for the same RCP and 2080. Similarly for the Southern and
        South-Western Flatlands cluster, the median for RCP8.5 and 2080 is 0.1 °C less than that for
        the same RCP and 2070. These features can be ascribed to the effects of increasing sample
        size and changes in sample composition on estimates of the median. Consequently revised
        estimates of the median temperature increase were determined using simple linear
        extrapolation and interpolation, and are denoted by asterisks in Tables A2.3 and
        A2.7.</para>

      <para>For a given NRM cluster, service life or planning horizon, RCP and
      class interval of projected increase in annual mean surface temperature,
      a projected rainfall intensity or equivalent depth (<emphasis

      <title>Step 6 – Consider Statutory Requirements</title>

      <para>Again consider Figure 4. If statutory requirements relating to
      climate change are in place, adopt the changed design. Otherwise, carry
      out an economic analysis (eg cost-benefit or cost effectiveness
      analysis, or multi-attribute utility theory) of potential changes in
      flood-related design requirements and make an informed decision on how
      to proceed.</para>
