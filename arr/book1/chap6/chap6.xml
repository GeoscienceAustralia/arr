    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>There is now widespread acceptance that human activities are contributing to observed
      climate change. Human induced climate change has the potential to alter the prevalence and
      severity of rainfall extremes, storm surge and floods. Recognition of the risks associated
      with climate change is required for better planning for new infrastructure and mitigating the
      potential damage to existing infrastructure.</para>

    <para>There are five aspects of design flood estimation that are likely to
    be impacted by climate change: <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>rainfall Intensity Frequency Duration (IFD) relationships;</para>

        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>and compound extremes (eg. riverine flooding combined with storm surge
            inundation).</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>The magnitudes of the impacts on any these areas have not
    been subjected to comprehensive study either nationally or
    internationally.</para>

    <para>The climate change projections released in 2015 show simulated increases in the magnitude
      of the wettest annual daily total and the 5% AEP wettest daily total across Australia
        <citation>b1_c6_r2</citation>. The projections do not include information about potential
      changes in IFD relationships and rainfall temporal patterns. Quite restricted sets of climate
      change projections for the Greater Sydney and southeast Queensland regions indicate that IFD
      relationships are sensitive to climate change <citation>b1_c6_r1</citation>. For example, the
      projections for Greater Sydney suggest that the 1% AEP for the 24 hour duration IFD will
      increase by up to 20% by 2050. To the west, in some parts of the Blue Mountains and beyond,
      decreases in the 1% AEP 24 hour duration IFD are possible. These projections are not
      definitive, however, since only one high-end greenhouse gas emissions scenario and a small set
      of climate model results were considered. For present climatic conditions, the analysis of
        <citation>b1_c6_r5+1</citation> indicates that temporal patterns of rainfall within storm
      bursts in Australia are impacted by temperature variations regardless of the climatic region
      and season. For the Greater Sydney region, <citation>b1_c6_r6+1</citation> found differing
      trends in annual maximum rainfall for different durations.</para>

    <para>This chapter provides practitioners, designers and decision makers with an approach to
      address the risks from climate change in projects and decisions that involve estimation of
      design flood characteristics while further research is undertaken to reduce key uncertainties.
      It draws on the most recent climate science, particularly the release of the IPCC Fifth
      Assessment Report <citation>b1_c6_r4</citation> as well as the new climate change projections
      for Australia <citation>b1_c6_r2</citation>. As such, the chapter is focused on potential
      changes in rainfall intensity (or equivalent depth) given the paucity of climate change
      projections for other factors that influence flood risk.</para>

    <para>For consistency with design rainfall IFD estimates for the current climate (<xref
        linkend="book2"/>), the chapter is intended to be applied to the key system design event
      (ie. the design standard for the structure or infrastructure). It is applicable for
      current-day rainfall intensities within the range of probability of one Exceedance per Year
      and 50% to 1% AEP. The approach described with this chapter considers regional risks from
      climate change, the effective service life (ie. the total period during which an asset remains
      in use) or the planning horizon of the decision (ie. the length of time that a plan looks into
      the future), the social acceptability and other consequences of failure, and the cost of
      retrofits. If climate change is found to be a significant issue for the infrastructure of
      interest through a screening analysis, a more detailed analysis is needed to draw on the best
      available knowledge of the likely future climate and to allow for changes in the intensity of
      heavy rainfall events over time.</para>

    <para>As the science of climate change is continually changing, it is
    anticipated that the chapter will be replaced gradually as new and
    detailed research findings are released. The latest published sources
    should always be sought for use in future assessments and decision making.
    The chapter does not replace the need for informed judgement of likely
    risks, or the need for detailed local analysis (for example through the
    use of additional climate and hydrological modelling) where the facilities
    under consideration are important and the risks potentially large.</para>

    <title>Climate Futures Web Tool</title>

    <para>The chapter uses output from the Climate Futures web tool developed by the CSIRO. Climate
      change projections are focussed on Natural Resource Management (NRM) ‘clusters’ (<xref
        linkend="b1_ch6_f_a82gy"/>). Projected changes from Global Climate Models (GCMs) can be
      explored for 14 20-year periods and the four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) for
      greenhouse gas and aerosol concentrations that were used to drive the GCMs. The RCPs are
      designated as 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5, and are named according to radiative forcing values (W
        m<superscript>-2</superscript>) in the year 2100 relative to pre-industrial values. Use of
      RCPs 4.5 and 8.5 (low and high concentrations, respectively) is recommended for impact
      assessment. Further details can be found at the Australian Climate Futures Website<footnote>

      </figure>Climate Futures subdivides the projected changes in two climate variables (eg.
      temperature and rainfall) from the full suite of GCMs into several classes, eg. warmer-wetter,
      hotter-drier, much hotter-much drier. The changes are relative to a 20-year (1986-2005)
      baseline. The resultant classification provides a visual display of the spread and clustering
      of the projected changes. This provides model consensus information for each class and assists
      the selection of the classes that are of most importance for impact assessment.</para>

    <para>Generally, there is more confidence in GCM simulations of
    temperature than for rainfall. Thus the chapter provides an adjustment
    factor for IFD curves informed by temperature projections alone. These
    temperature projections are then combined with current understanding of
    changes to extreme rainfall event intensities based on research in
    Australia and overseas. This research includes observation-based
    assessments, physical arguments on the water holding capacity of a warmer
    atmosphere and high resolution dynamical downscaling experiments. Using
    these multiple lines of evidence the expected change in heavy rainfalls is
    between 2% and 15% per °C of warming.</para>

    <sidebar>
      <para>Given the uncertainty in rainfall projections and their
      considerable regional variability, an increase in rainfall (intensity or
      depth) of 5% per °C of local warming is recommended.</para>
    </sidebar>

    <para>Given the uncertainty in rainfall projections and their considerable
    regional variability, an increase in rainfall (intensity or depth) of 5%
    per °C of local warming is recommended. The proposed rate of increase has
    been tempered because: there is no guarantee that the same scaling will
    apply across all of the frequencies and durations typically considered in
    flood design, and there are other factors that have the potential to
    affect future rainfall intensities (or depths) over land. These include
    changes in regional atmospheric circulation, synoptic systems and soil
    wetness.</para>

    <title>Interim Climate Change Guideline</title>

    <para>Failure to account for potential climate hazards can lead to poor
    decisions, particularly when the exposure risk to climate change is medium
    to high. In these circumstances, a reasonable approach is to make a
    decision that is robust against a range of plausible futures. These
    futures can be obtained from the Climate Futures web tool. Where exposure
    to climate change and the consequences of failure of the asset of interest
    are high, more detailed local studies including the use of downscaling
    methods are recommended. This approach ensures a balance between
    standardising practice and allowing for the use of informed professional
    judgement.</para>

    <para>For consistency with the design rainfall IFD estimates in <xref linkend="book2"/>, the
      chapter is intended to be applied to the design event (ie. the design standard for the
      structure or infrastructure). It is applicable for rainfall intensities under the current
      climatic regime within the range of probability of one exceedance per year and 50% to 1% AEP.
      Other mechanisms that affect the magnitude of flooding, such as tailwater levels and oceanic
      processes (eg. wind, waves and tides) are not considered. Where there is an additional risk of
      coastal flooding from sea level rise refer to <citation>b1_c6_r3+1</citation> for
      guidance.</para>

    <para>A six-step process is used to incorporate climate change risks into
    decisions involving the estimation of design flood characteristics. The
    process uses a decision tree approach that enables the practitioner to
    define the nature of the information needed for a particular problem and
    to reach an appropriate course of action (see <xref
    linkend="b1_ch6_f_31m1s"/> to <xref linkend="b1_ch6_f_7i1uk"/> or <xref

      <title>Step 1 – Set the Effective Service Life or Planning
      Horizon</title>

      <para>The first consideration is the effective service life of an asset
      or planning horizon of an activity (<xref linkend="b1_ch6_f_31m1s"/>).
      This underpins the design philosophy and may fundamentally control the
      selection of material, methods and expertise. In current practice, a
      broad perspective on effective service life may be required
      incorporating engineering, client and community perspectives. Potential
      climate change considerations may influence these decisions,
      particularly as the risks from climate change are likely to increase
      over time.</para>

      <para>If the effective service life or planning horizon is relatively
      short (less than 20 years from 2015) climate change will have negligible
      impact on IFD characteristics over that period of time. Thus the
      projected hazard will be similar to the present, and the design process
      should be based on the IFD and temporal patterns described in <xref
      linkend="book2"/>. Otherwise, proceed to Step 2.<figure

      <para>Again consider <xref linkend="b1_ch6_f_31m1s"/>. If the design
      standard is the Probable Maximum Flood (PMF), use an up-to-date estimate
      of the Probable Maximum Precipitation (PMP) to determine the PMF. This
      approach has an appropriate degree of conservatism as PMP estimates are
      updated by the Bureau of Meteorology from time to time. This will ensure
      that any future climate change signal is captured and thus the PMP
      should not be further adjusted to take into account potential climate
      change implications. Otherwise, proceed to Step 3.</para>

      <title>Step 3 – Consider the Purpose and Nature of the Asset or Activity
      and Consequences of its Failure</title>

      <para>Consider <xref linkend="b1_ch6_f_yzgm5"/>. Here ‘purpose of the asset’ can refer to flow
        conveyance, improved safety, and reduced frequency of exposure and damage. Flood-related
        design requirements (eg. minimum fill levels and minimum floor levels) need to be
        considered, as well as the consequences of failure (eg. risks to life, property and the
        environment) and the cost of retrofitting assets if IFD characteristics change with
        time.</para>

      <para>The impact of the possible failure of the facility (eg. asset, process or management
        strategy) will have direct and indirect consequences, and should be assessed in terms of
        primary risk outcomes such as issues of cost, safety, social acceptability and environmental
        impact. Some categorisation of facilities may be useful when determining the consequences of
        failure. For example, there can be substantial consequences if assets related to the
        delivery of essential services fail or are significantly impacted.</para>

      <para>The consequences of failure can be rated as either low, medium or
      high:</para>

        <listitem>

      <title>Step 4 – Carry out a Climate Change Risk Screening
      Analysis</title>

      <para>Again consider <xref linkend="b1_ch6_f_yzgm5"/>. Step 4 responds
      to the question: Is climate change a significant issue for the facility
      of interest? Here the risks of climate change are assessed with regard
      to their capacity to impair the facility’s ability to perform its
      intended function. The description of impact or failure involves the use
      of heavy rainfall events with different AEPs. This task can be
      facilitated by use of the AEPs listed in <xref
      linkend="b1_ch6_t_oppcr"/>. Recall that the scope of this chapter is
      limited to events more frequent than the 1% AEP. If the design AEP
      corresponds to the <emphasis
      role="italic">i</emphasis><superscript>th</superscript> row in <xref
      linkend="b1_ch6_t_oppcr"/>, consider the impact of the AEP events

      <para>The outputs from this step include a good understanding of the extent to which the risks
        of climate change may exceed the coping capacity of the facility to perform its intended
        function. If the incremental impact and consequences are low (eg. increases in flood levels
        are slight) then the exposure risk to climate change is low, and design rainfall should be
        determined using <xref linkend="book2"/>. Otherwise, proceed to Step 5.</para>

      <para><xref linkend="b1_ch6_s_95vhl"/> contains a summary of relevant information provided the
        Climate Futures web tool. For each NRM cluster (<xref linkend="b1_ch6_f_a82gy"/>), the GCM
        consensus cases are listed for four class intervals (ranges) of projected annual mean
        surface temperature increases for RCPs 4.5 and 8.5 relative to the 1986 – 2005 baseline. The
        class intervals are ‘slightly warmer’ (&lt; 0.5 °C), ‘warmer’ (0.5 to 1.5 °C), ‘hotter’ (1.5
        to 3 °C) and ‘much hotter’ (&gt; 3 °C). As the upper class interval is open-ended, median
        temperature increases (in parentheses) are given for cases containing one of more GCMs.
        Generally, the median temperature increase for the ‘much hotter’ class interval increases
        with increasing service life or planning horizon. This is not the case for the Monsoonal
        North cluster where the median increase for RCP 8.5 and 2090 is 0.1 °C less than that for
        the same RCP and 2080. Similarly for the Southern and South-Western Flatlands cluster, the
        median for RCP 8.5 and 2080 is 0.1 °C less than that for the same RCP and 2070. These
        features can be ascribed to the effects of increasing sample size and changes in sample
        composition on estimates of the median. Consequently revised estimates of the median
        temperature increase were determined using simple linear extrapolation and interpolation,
