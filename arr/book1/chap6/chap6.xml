    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>There is now widespread acceptance that human activities are contributing to observed
      climate change. Human-induced climate change has the potential to alter the prevalence and
      severity of rainfall extremes, storm surge and floods. Recognition of the risks associated
      with climate change is required for better planning for new infrastructure and mitigating the
      potential damage to existing infrastructure.</para>
    <para>There are five aspects of design flood estimation that are likely to be impacted by
      climate change: <itemizedlist>

          </para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>The magnitudes of the impacts on any these areas have not been subjected to
      comprehensive study either nationally or internationally. </para>
    <para>The climate change projections released in 2015 show simulated increases in the magnitude
      of the wettest annual daily total and the 5% AEP wettest daily total across Australia (CSIRO
      and Bureau of Meteorology, 2015). The projections do not include information about potential
      changes in IFD relationships and rainfall temporal patterns. Quite restricted sets of climate
      change projections for the Greater Sydney and southeast Queensland regions indicate that IFD
      relationships are sensitive to climate change (Bates et al., 2015). For example, the
      projections for Greater Sydney suggest that the 1% AEP for the 24 hour duration IFD will
      increase by up to 20% by 2050. To the west, in some parts of the Blue Mountains and beyond,
      decreases in the 1% AEP 24 hour duration IFD are possible. These projections are not
      definitive, however, since only one high-end greenhouse gas emissions scenario and a small set
      of climate model results were considered. For present climatic conditions, the analysis of
      Wasko and Sharma (2015) indicates that temporal patterns of rainfall within storm bursts in
      Australia are impacted by temperature variations regardless of the climatic region and season.
      For the Greater Sydney region, Zheng et al. (2015) found differing trends in annual maximum
      rainfall for different durations.</para>
    <para>This chapter provides practitioners, designers and decision makers with an approach to
      address the risks from climate change in projects and decisions that involve estimation of
      design flood characteristics while further research is undertaken to reduce key uncertainties.
      It draws on the most recent climate science, particularly the release of the IPCC Fifth
      Assessment Report (IPCC, 2013) as well as the new climate change projections for Australia
      (CSIRO and Bureau of Meteorology, 2015). As such, the chapter is focused on potential changes
      in rainfall intensity (or equivalent depth) given the paucity of climate change projections
      for other factors that influence flood risk.</para>
    <para>For consistency with design rainfall IFD estimates for the current climate(<xref
        linkend="book2"/>), the chapter is intended to be applied to the key system design event (ie
      the design standard for the structure or infrastructure). It is applicable for current-day
      rainfall intensities within the range of probability of one Exceedance per Year and 50% to 1%
      AEP. The approach described withi this chapter considers regional risks from climate change,
      the effective service life (ie the total period during which an asset remains in use) or the
      planning horizon of the decision (ie the length of time that a plan looks into the future),
      the social acceptability and other consequences of failure, and the cost of retrofits. If
      climate change is found to be a significant issue for the infrastructure of interest through a
      screening analysis, a more detailed analysis is needed to draw on the best available knowledge
      of the likely future climate and to allow for changes in the intensity of heavy rainfall
      events over time.</para>
    <para>As the science of climate change is continually changing, it is anticipated that the
      chapter will be replaced gradually as new and detailed research findings are released. The
      latest published sources should always be sought for use in future assessments and decision
      making. The chapter does not replace the need for informed judgement of likely risks, or the
      need for detailed local analysis (for example through the use of additional climate and
      hydrological modelling) where the facilities under consideration are important and the risks
      potentially large.</para>

    <title>Climate Futures Web Tool</title>
    <para>The chapter uses output from the Climate Futures web tool developed by the CSIRO. Climate
      change projections are focussed on Natural Resource Management (NRM) ‘clusters’ (<xref
        linkend="b1_ch6_f_a82gy"/>). Projected changes from Global Climate Models (GCMs) can be
      explored for 14 20-year periods and the four Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) for
      greenhouse gas and aerosol concentrations that were used to drive the GCMs. The RCPs are
      designated as 2.6, 4.5, 6.0 and 8.5, and are named according to radiative forcing values (W
      m-2) in the year 2100 relative to pre-industrial values. Use of RCPs 4.5 and 8.5 (low and high
      concentrations, respectively) is recommended for impact assessment. Further details can be
      found at the Australian Climate Futures Website<footnote>

      </figure>Climate Futures subdivides the projected changes in two climate variables (eg.
      temperature and rainfall) from the full suite of GCMs into several classes, eg warmer-wetter,
      hotter-drier, much hotter-much drier. The changes are relative to a 20-year (1986-2005)
      baseline. The resultant classification provides a visual display of the spread and clustering
      of the projected changes. This provides model consensus information for each class and assists
      the selection of the classes that are of most importance for impact assessment.</para>
    <para>Generally, there is more confidence in GCM simulations of temperature than for rainfall.
      Thus the chapter provides an adjustment factor for IFD curves informed by temperature
      projections alone. These temperature projections are then combined with current understanding
      of changes to extreme rainfall event intensities based on research in Australia and overseas.
      This research includes observation-based assessments, physical arguments on the water holding
      capacity of a warmer atmosphere and high resolution dynamical downscaling experiments. Using
      these multiple lines of evidence the expected change in heavy rainfalls is between 2% and 15%
      per °C of warming.</para>
    <para>Given the uncertainty in rainfall projections and their considerable regional variability,
      an increase in rainfall (intensity or depth) of 5% per °C of local warming is recommended. The
      proposed rate of increase has been tempered because: there is no guarantee that the same
      scaling will apply across all of the frequencies and durations typically considered in flood
      design, and there are other factors that have the potential to affect future rainfall
      intensities (or depths) over land. These include changes in regional atmospheric circulation,
      synoptic systems and soil wetness.</para>

    <title>Interim Climate Change Guideline</title>
    <para>Failure to account for potential climate hazards can lead to poor decisions, particularly
      when the exposure risk to climate change is medium to high. In these circumstances, a
      reasonable approach is to make a decision that is robust against a range of plausible futures.
      These futures can be obtained from the Climate Futures web tool. Where exposure to climate
      change and the consequences of failure of the asset of interest are high, more detailed local
      studies including the use of downscaling methods are recommended. This approach ensures a
      balance between standardising practice and allowing for the use of informed professional
      judgement.</para>
    <para>For consistency with the design rainfall IFD estimates in <xref linkend="book2"/>, the
      chapter is intended to be applied to the design event (ie the design standard for the
      structure or infrastructure). It is applicable for rainfall intensities under the current
      climatic regime within the range of probability of one exceedance per year and

    <para>A six-step process is used to incorporate climate change risks into decisions involving
      the estimation of design flood characteristics. The process uses a decision tree approach that

      <title>Step 5 – Consider Climate Change Projections and their Consequences</title>
      <para>Consider <xref linkend="b1_ch6_f_7i1uk"/>. At this point the consequences of impact on
        performance and exposure risk to climate change have been judged to be medium or high. Hence
        consideration needs to be given to whether the original design specifications of the project
        or the decision need to be reviewed and adjusted. This necessitates the use of climate
        change projections. The selection of projections or scenarios is an important source of
        uncertainty in the use of GCM outputs.</para>
      <para><?oxy_insert_start author="testoni" timestamp="20151125T103612+1100"?>In reaching Step
        5, the minimum basis for design should be the low greenhouse gas and aerosol concentration
        pathway RCP4.5 and the maximum GCM consensus case indicated by the Climate Futures web tool
        for the NRM cluster of interest (Section
        4).<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="testoni" timestamp="20151125T103612+1100" content="&lt;emphasis role=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;In reaching Step 5, the minimum basis for design should be the low greenhouse gas and aerosol concentration pathway RCP4.5 and the maximum GCM consensus case indicated by the Climate Futures web tool for the NRM cluster of interest (Section 4).&lt;/emphasis&gt;"?>
        The choice of RCP4.5 is recommended because RCP2.6 requires ambitious global emissions
        reductions. The maximum consensus case is a reasonable choice since it is not unduly
        affected by outlying GCM results.
        <?oxy_insert_start author="testoni" timestamp="20151125T103613+1100"?>Where the additional

      <para><xref linkend="b1_ch6_s_95vhl"/> contains a summary of relevant information provided the
        Climate Futures web tool. For each NRM cluster (<xref linkend="b1_ch6_f_a82gy"/>), the GCM
        consensus cases are listed for four class intervals (ranges) of projected annual mean
        surface temperature increases for RCPs 4.5 and 8.5 relative to the 1986 – 2005 baseline. The
        class intervals are ‘slightly warmer’ (&lt; 0.5 °C), ‘warmer’ (0.5 to 1.5 °C), ‘hotter’ (1.5
        to 3 °C) and ‘much hotter’ (&gt; 3 °C). As the upper class interval is open-ended, median
        temperature increases (in parentheses) are given for cases containing one of more GCMs.
        Generally, the median temperature increase for the ‘much hotter’ class interval increases
        with increasing service life or planning horizon. This is not the case for the Monsoonal
        North cluster where the median increase for RCP8.5 and 2090 is 0.1 °C less than that for the
        same RCP and 2080. Similarly for the Southern and South-Western Flatlands cluster, the
        median for RCP8.5 and 2080 is 0.1 °C less than that for the same RCP and 2070. These
        features can be ascribed to the effects of increasing sample size and changes in sample
        composition on estimates of the median. Consequently revised estimates of the median
        temperature increase were determined using simple linear extrapolation and interpolation,
        and are denoted by asterisks in <xref linkend="b1_ch6_t_cziry"/> and <xref
          linkend="b1_ch6_t_0ygpo"/>.</para>
