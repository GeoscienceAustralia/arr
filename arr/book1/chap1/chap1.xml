    <title>General</title>
    <para>While previous editions of Australian Rainfall and Runoff have served the engineering
      profession and the general community well, in the period since the release of the previous
      edition, a number of developments have arisen that necessitate the production of a new
      edition. These developments include the many recent advances in knowledge regarding flood
      processes, the increased computational capacity available to engineering hydrologists,

    <para>In this edition of Australian Rainfall and Runoff, many of the recommended practices

      Since publication of the last edition of Australian Rainfall and Runoff, it has been
      recognised that this focus on flows provided insufficient guidance on other flood
      characteristics.<?oxy_insert_start author="testoni" timestamp="20151127T145137+1100"?> For the
      holistic planning, design and operation of flood management systems, flood characteristics
      other than peak flow will also be relevant.<?oxy_insert_end?> For example, the design flood
      storage for the many retarding basins located in urban areas
      <?oxy_delete author="retallick" timestamp="20151126T110834+1100" content="usually"?>
      is<?oxy_insert_start author="retallick" timestamp="20151126T110837+1100"?>
      usually<?oxy_insert_end?> a flood volume issue rather than a peak flow
      issue<?oxy_insert_start author="retallick" timestamp="20151126T110849+1100"?>.<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="testoni" timestamp="20151127T145118+1100" content="; in this example, it is the peak volume stored that is the design consideration given constraints arising from upstream and downstream flows."?>
      As a result, other recommendations in this edition of Australian Rainfall and Runoff focus on
      all flood characteristics that may be of interest in design flood
      <?oxy_delete author="testoni" timestamp="20151127T145149+1100" content="prediction"?><?oxy_insert_start author="testoni" timestamp="20151127T145149+1100"?>estimation<?oxy_insert_end?>.</para>
    <para>This approach is consistent with the aims of Engineers Australia's National Committee on

      design data to be extracted from databases (e.g. for the design rainfall database and the
      regional flood frequency estimation). These databases will be updated when warranted by the
      availability of significant amounts of new or revised information. </para>

This has resulted in misinterpretation by the profession, the general community impacted by floods, and other stakeholders.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In considering the terminology that should be used in this edition of Australian Rainfall and Runoff, the National Committee on Water Engineering had three major concerns; namely&lt;/para&gt;&lt;itemizedlist mark=&quot;bullet&quot;&gt;&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;Clarity of meaning;&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;Technical correctness; and&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;Practicality and acceptability.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;&lt;/itemizedlist&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section xml:id=&quot;b1_ch1-3_s_xe7xl&quot;&gt;&lt;title&gt;Clarity of Meaning&lt;/title&gt;&lt;para&gt;Use of the terms &quot;&lt;emphasis role=&quot;italic&quot;&gt;recurrence interval&lt;/emphasis&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;emphasis role=&quot;italic&quot;&gt;return period&lt;/emphasis&gt;&quot; has been criticised as leading to confusion in the minds of some decision-makers and members of the public. Although the terms are simple superficially, they are misinterpreted regularly as implying that the associated event magnitude is only exceeded at regular intervals, and that they are referring to the elapsed time till the next exceedance. This misinterpretation of the terms used for expressing probabilities of flood magnitudes can be misleading and result in poor decisions.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;It is believed that irrespective of the terms used, that it is critical that all stakeholders have a common interpretation of the terms. Furthermore, it is believed that it is important that stakeholders understand that the terms refer to long term averages. This means, for a given climatic environment, that the probability of an event of a given magnitude being equalled or exceeded in a given period of time (for example, one year) is unchanged throughout the life of the structure or the drainage network. Furthermore, it is not uncommon for more than one occurrence of an event to occur in a single year. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Additionally, given the wet and dry phases that occur in many regions of Australia, these events are likely to be clustered in time. The occurrence of these wet and dry climatic phases highlight the misleading and inappropriate interpretation that flood events occur at regular intervals as implied by &quot;&lt;emphasis role=&quot;italic&quot;&gt;recurrence interval&lt;/emphasis&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;emphasis role=&quot;italic&quot;&gt;return period&lt;/emphasis&gt;”.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Flood events generally are random occurrences, and the period between exceedances of a given value usually is a random variate, the properties of which are assumed to be constant in time for a given location and climatic environment. The adopted terminology reflects this fundamental concept and is intended to convey a clear and precise interpretation.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section xml:id=&quot;b1_ch1-3_s_ijnsl&quot;&gt;&lt;title&gt;Technical Correctness&lt;/title&gt;&lt;para&gt;In view of the loose and frequently incorrect manner in which probability terms are often used, it was considered that Australian Rainfall and Runoff should adopt terminology that is technically correct, as far as this is possible and in harmony with other objectives. Additionally, even if this is not entirely popular with all users, Engineers Australia has a responsibility to encourage and educate engineers regarding correct terminology.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The two approaches used when describing probabilities of flood events in previous editions of Australian Rainfall and Runoff were:&lt;/para&gt;&lt;itemizedlist mark=&quot;bullet&quot;&gt;&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) - the probability of an event being equalled or exceeded within a year. Typically the AEP is estimated by extracting the annual maximum in each year to produce an Annual Maxima Series (AMS); and&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;&lt;listitem&gt;&lt;para&gt;Average Recurrence Interval (ARI) - the average time period between occurrences equalling or exceeding a given value. Usually the ARI is derived from a Peak over Threshold series (PoTs) where every value over a chosen threshold is extracted from the period of record.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/listitem&gt;&lt;/itemizedlist&gt;&lt;para&gt;Details of AMS and PoTs and the background to these alternative techniques for extracting flood series from recorded data are presented in Chapter 2 of Book 1 of Australian Rainfall and Runoff. Included in this discussion are the assumptions necessary for conversion of one probability terminology to the other using the Langbein formula (Langbein, 1949).&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Using the Langbein formula, in probability terms, there is little practical difference for events rarer than 10% AEP. Historically, however, there has been a reluctance to convert from the approach used for derivation of the design flood estimate. Furthermore, terminology was attached to particular design flood estimation techniques; for example, when AMS were used to derive design flood estimates, the resultant probability was expressed as an AEP while when a PoTS was used for the same purpose, the resultant probability was expressed as an ARI.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;In many situations, this distinction between an ARI and an AEP was imprecise as the design flood prediction methodology adopted did not explicitly note use of either an AMS or a PoTS in the methodology. As a result, use of ARI and AEP was considered to be interchangeable. This interchangeable use often resulted in confusion.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The National Committee on Water Engineering believes that within Australian Rainfall and Runoff a terminology should be used which, while being technically correct, is consistent with other uses. Furthermore, the terminology adopted should be easily understood both by the profession and by other stakeholders within the community. &lt;/para&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section xml:id=&quot;b1_ch1-3_s_c6s8d&quot;&gt;&lt;title&gt;Practicality and Acceptability&lt;/title&gt;&lt;para&gt;The National Committee on Water Engineering is aware that while the terminology adopted must be technically correct it must also be relatively simple and suitable for use in practice. Terminology that meets this criterion will be accepted by the profession and by other stakeholders.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;A change from the terminology adopted in the 1987 Edition of Australian Rainfall and Runoff has been deemed necessary as some confusion still exists with regard to the interpretation of certain terminology. This confusion exists both within the profession and within the community and other stakeholders.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;The interaction of the profession with the community and the increased public participation in decision making means that terminology needs to be clear not only to the profession but also to the community and other stakeholders, other professions involved in flood management, and to the managers of flood-prone land. This need has resulted in a strong move for a clear and unambiguous terminology by the National Committee on Water Engineering of Engineers Australia and the National Flood Risk Advisory Group (NFRAG): NFRAG is a reference group under the Australian and New Zealand Emergency Management Committee. All parties believe that terminology involving annual percentage probability best conveys the likelihood of flooding and is less open to misinterpretation by the public.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;section xml:id=&quot;b1_ch1-3_s_aona4&quot;&gt;&lt;title&gt;Adopted Terminology&lt;/title&gt;&lt;para&gt;The term x year ARI and 1 in x AEP has caused confusion both within the industry and with the community and other stakeholders. It has been interpreted by many to imply that the periods between exceedances of a given event magnitude.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;To mitigate this confusion, the National Committee on Water Engineering has decided to adopt the terms shown in &lt;xref linkend=&quot;arr_pref_term_table&quot;/&gt; and the suggested usage as indicated in that table.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;table xml:id=&quot;arr_pref_term_table&quot; class=&quot;table table-bordered table-hover&quot;&gt;&lt;caption&gt; Australian Rainfall and Runoff Preferred Terminology&lt;/caption&gt;&lt;thead&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;th scope=&quot;col&quot;&gt;EY&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th scope=&quot;col&quot;&gt;AEP (%)&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th scope=&quot;col&quot;&gt;AEP (1 in x)&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th scope=&quot;col&quot;&gt;ARI&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th scope=&quot;col&quot;&gt;Use&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/thead&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;colour_bfcbe3&quot;&gt;&lt;?dbfo bgcolor=&quot;#bfcbe3&quot;?&gt;6&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;?dbfo bgcolor=&quot;#ffffff&quot;?&gt;99.75&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;?dbfo bgcolor=&quot;#ffffff&quot;?&gt;1.002&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;?dbfo bgcolor=&quot;#ffffff&quot;?&gt;0.17&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td rowspan=&quot;5&quot;

Additionally, AEP are to be expressed using percentage probability; for example, the 1% AEP design flood discharge. However, their will be situations where the use of percentage probability is not practicable; expression of extreme flood probabilities associated with dam spillways are one example of a situation where percentage probability is not appropriate. In these cases, it is recommended that the probability be expressed as 1 in X AEP where 100/X would be the equivalent percentage probability.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;For more frequent events an annualised exceedance probability is misleading and confusing. Furthermore, a recurrence interval approach also is misleading where strong seasonality is experienced. An example of strong seasonality is where the rainfall occurs predominately during the Summer or Winter period and as a consequence flood flows are more likely to occur during that period. As a result, when strong seasonality exists, calculating a design flood flow with a 3 month recurrence interval is of limited value as the expectation of the time period between occurrences will not be consistent throughout the year. For example, a flow with the magnitude of a 3 month recurrence interval would be expected to occur or be exceeded 4 times a year; however, in situations where there is strong seasonality in the rainfall, all of the occurrences are likely to occur in the dominate season.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Consequently, events more frequent than 50% AEP should be expressed as X Exceedances per Year (EY). For example, 2 EY is equivalent to a design event with a 6 month recurrence interval when there is no seasonality in flood occurrence.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;An additional consideration in reducing the confusion is that different users of Australian Rainfall and Runoff, in general, will use different segments of the relationship between flood magnitude and exceedance probability. As the desire is to reduce confusion, switching between different terminologies within an industry segment will not reduce confusion but rather increase the confusion. Hence, while the recommended terminology for alternative frequencies is presented in &lt;xref linkend=&quot;arr_pref_term_table&quot;/&gt;, it is recognised that usage may differ from the suggestions shown in &lt;xref linkend=&quot;arr_pref_term_table&quot;/&gt;.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;Finally, it should be noted that no consideration has been given to the long term effects of climatic change in developing this terminology. Nonetheless, the adopted terminology is considered to be equally applicable to both stationary and non-stationary climatic environments as there is no requirement for the annual exceedance probabilities to be constant over time. In other words, there is no requirement for a given flood characteristic magnitude to maintain a given AEP over different years or, conversely, for a given AEP to maintain a constant flood characteristic magnitude over different years.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;/section&gt;&lt;/section&gt;"?>

Included in this discussion is the differences between simulation of a historical event and simulation of a design event and the terminology relevant to catchment simulation. This initial chapter is followed by a discussion of the types of catchment modelling systems (event and continuous) and the associated concepts of these systems in the following chapter. A important component of this discussion would be the need for integrated hydrologic, and hydraulic components of the system and recognition of the different focal points of these components. Presented in the next chapter is a discussion of how catchment processes are integrated in the modelling system and how information obtained from the catchment modelling system is dependent on the processes incorporated in the system. Furthermore, it is intended to highlight how the values of the same parameter (for example, the loss rate parameter) depend upon how the modelling system is conceptualised and the various processes combined in the system.&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;&lt;emphasis role=&quot;italic&quot;&gt;BOOKook 5 &lt;/emphasis&gt;- FLOOD HYDROGRAPH ESTIMATION&lt;/para&gt;&lt;para&gt;This book comprises five chapters. The focus of this book is the hydrologic models necessary for prediction of design flood hydrographs. As with previous books, the first chapter is a general introduction to concepts presented in this book while the remaining chapters will deal with particular theories, techniques and their application. The first of the technical chapters deals with the different types of hydrologic model, namely burst and event runoff models and continuous runoff estimation; the focus of this discussion will be the flow components and their estimation in either event modelling or continuous modelling. Following that discussion is a chapter on alternative approaches for direct runoff estimation inclusive of time-area, unitgraph, kinematic, diffusion, and 2-dimensional dynamic.
