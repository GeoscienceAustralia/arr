  <title>Flood Concepts</title>

  <para>This section needs to take the probability concepts introduced in the
  introduction and present them as the foundation of the probability of
  floods. Included in this discussion needs to be the assumptions implicitly
  and explicitly adopted to enable the approach. Also, the discussion of flood
  probability needs to be independent of hydrograph characteristic; in other
  words it needs to be applicable to any hydrograph characteristic.
  Nonetheless, it needs to highlight why flows are used predominately, i.e.
  the continuous flood probability model whereas level has a discontinuous
  flood probability model.</para>
