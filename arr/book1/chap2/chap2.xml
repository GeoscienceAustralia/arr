    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>This chapter introduces important concepts of probability and statistics with respect to
      flood estimation, and defines the recommended terminology for these probability concepts. The
      chapter also discusses the difference between design and actual events, conversion of rainfall
      of a given probability to a flood of the same probability, risk-based design and dealing with
      uncertainty in flood estimates. Much of the text from the 1987 edition of ARR is still
      relevant and has formed the basis for the information provided in some of following
      sections.</para>

      <title>Background</title>
      <para>Probability concepts are fundamental to design flood estimation and appropriate
        terminology is important for effective communication of design flood estimates. Terms
        commonly used in the past have included "<emphasis role="italic">recurrence
          interval</emphasis>", "<emphasis role="italic">return period</emphasis>", and various
        terms involving "<emphasis role="italic">probability</emphasis>". It is common for these
        terms to be used in a loose manner, and sometimes quite incorrectly. This has resulted in
        misinterpretation by the profession, the general community impacted by floods, and other
        stakeholders.</para>
      <para>In considering the terminology that should be used in this edition of Australian
        Rainfall and Runoff, the National Committee on Water Engineering's three major concerns
        were:</para>

      <title>Clarity of Meaning</title>
      <para>Use of the terms "<emphasis role="italic">recurrence interval</emphasis>" and "<emphasis role="italic">return period</emphasis>" has been criticised as leading to confusion in the
        minds of some decision-makers and members of the public. Although the terms are simple
        superficially, they are misinterpreted regularly as implying that the associated event
        magnitude is only exceeded at regular intervals, and that they are referring to the expected
        elapsed time till the next exceedance. This misinterpretation of the terms used for
        expressing probabilities of flood magnitudes can be misleading and result in poor
        decisions.</para>
      <para>It is believed that irrespective of the terms used, it is critical that all stakeholders
        have a common interpretation of the terms. Furthermore, it is important that stakeholders
        understand that the terms refer to long term averages. This means, for a given climatic
        environment, that the probability of an event of a given magnitude being equalled or
        exceeded in a given period of time (for example, one year) is unchanged throughout the life
        of the structure or the drainage network. Furthermore, it is not uncommon for an event to
        occur for than once in a single year.</para>
      <para>Additionally, given the wet and dry phases that occur in many regions of Australia,
        these events are likely to be clustered in time. The occurrence of these wet and dry
        climatic phases highlight the misleading and inappropriate interpretation that flood events
        occur at regular intervals as implied by "<emphasis role="italic">recurrence
          interval</emphasis>" and "<emphasis role="italic">return period</emphasis>”.</para>
      <para>Flood events generally are random occurrences, and the period between exceedances of a
        given event magnitude usually is a random variate, the properties of which are assumed to be
        constant in time for a given location and climatic environment. The adopted terminology
        reflects this fundamental concept and is intended to convey a clear and precise
        interpretation.</para>

    <section xml:id="b1_ch1-3_s_ijnsl">
      <title>Technical Correctness</title>
      <para>In view of the loose and frequently incorrect manner in which probability terms are
        often used, it was considered that Australian Rainfall and Runoff should adopt terminology
        that is technically correct, as far as this is possible and in harmony with other
        objectives. Additionally, even if this is not entirely popular with all practitioners,
        Engineers Australia has a responsibility to encourage and educate engineers regarding
        correct terminology.</para>
      <para>The two approaches used when describing probabilities of flood events in previous
        editions of Australian Rainfall and Runoff were:</para>
      <itemizedlist mark="bullet">
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) </emphasis>- the probability of an
            event being equalled or exceeded within a year. Typically the AEP is estimated by
            extracting the annual maximum in each year to produce an Annual Maxima Series (AMS);
            and</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para><emphasis>Average Recurrence Interval (ARI) </emphasis>- the average time period
            between occurrences equalling or exceeding a given value. Usually the ARI is derived
            from a Peak over Threshold series (PoTS) where every value over a chosen threshold is
            extracted from the period of record.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>Details of AMS and PoTs and the background to these alternative techniques for
        extracting flood series from recorded data are presented in Chapter 2 of Book 3 of
        Australian Rainfall and Runoff. Included in this discussion are the assumptions necessary
        for conversion of one probability terminology to the other using the Langbein formula
        (Langbein, 1949).</para>
      <para>Using the Langbein formula, in probability terms, there is little practical difference
        for events rarer than 10% AEP. Historically, however, there has been a reluctance to convert
        from the approach used for derivation of the design flood estimate. Furthermore, terminology
        was attached to particular design flood estimation techniques; for example, when AMS were
        used to derive design flood estimates, the resultant probability was expressed as an AEP
        while when a PoTS was used for the same purpose, the resultant probability was expressed as
        an ARI.</para>
      <para>In many situations, this distinction between an ARI and an AEP was imprecise as the
        design flood prediction methodology adopted did not explicitly note the use of either an AMS
        or a PoTS in the methodology. As a result, use of ARI and AEP was considered to be
        interchangeable. This interchangeable use often resulted in confusion.</para>
      <para>The National Committee on Water Engineering believes that within Australian Rainfall and
        Runoff a terminology should be used which, while being technically correct, is consistent
        with other uses. Furthermore, the terminology adopted should be easily understood both by
        the profession and by other stakeholders within the community.</para>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="b1_ch1-3_s_c6s8d">
      <title>Practicality and Acceptability</title>
      <para>The National Committee on Water Engineering is aware that while the terminology adopted
        must be technically correct it must also be relatively simple and suitable for use in
        practice. Terminology that meets this criterion will be accepted by the profession and by
        other stakeholders.</para>
      <para>The interaction of the profession with the community and the increased public
        participation in decision making means that terminology needs to be clear not only to the
        profession but also to the community and other stakeholders, other professions involved in
        flood management, and to the managers of flood-prone land. This need has resulted in a move
        away from the terminology adopted in the 1987 Edition of Australian Rainfall and Runoff
        towards a clear and unambiguous terminology supported by the National Committee on Water
        Engineering of Engineers Australia and the National Flood Risk Advisory Group (NFRAG, a
        reference group under the Australian and New Zealand Emergency Management Committee). All
        parties believe that terminology involving annual percentage probability best conveys the
        likelihood of flooding and is less open to misinterpretation by the public.</para>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="b1_ch1-3_s_aona4">
      <title>Adopted Terminology</title>
      <para>To achieve the desired clarity of meaning, technical correctness, practicality and
        acceptability, the National Committee on Water Engineering has decided to adopt the terms
        shown in <xref linkend="arr_pref_term_table"/> and the suggested frequency
        indicators.</para>
      <figure xml:id="arr_pref_term_table">

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>
      <para>Navy outline indicates preferred terminology. Shading indicates acceptable terminology
        which is depends on the typical use. For example in floodplain management 0.5% AEP might be
        used while in dam design this event would be described as a 1 in 200 AEP.</para>
      <para>As shown in the third column of <xref linkend="arr_pref_term_table"/>, the term Annual
        Exceedance Probability (AEP) expresses the probability of an event being equalled or
        exceeded in any year in percentage terms, for example, the 1% AEP design flood discharge.
        There will be situations where the use of percentage probability is not practicable; extreme
        flood probabilities associated with dam spillways are one example of a situation where
        percentage probability is not appropriate. In these cases, it is recommended that the
        probability be expressed as 1 in X AEP where 100/X would be the equivalent percentage
        probability.</para>
      <para>For events more frequent than 50% AEP, expressing frequency in terms of annual
        exceedance probability is not meaningful and misleading , as probability is constrained to a
        maximum value of 1.0 or 100%. Furthermore, where strong seasonality is experienced, a
        recurrence interval approach would also be misleading. An example of strong seasonality is
        where the rainfall occurs predominately during the Summer or Winter period and as a
        consequence flood flows are more likely to occur during that period. Accordingly, when
        strong seasonality exists, calculating a design flood flow with a 3 month recurrence
        interval is of limited value as the expectation of the time period between occurrences will
        not be consistent throughout the year. For example, a flow with the magnitude of a 3 month
        recurrence interval would be expected to occur or be exceeded 4 times a year; however, in
        situations where there is strong seasonality in the rainfall, all of the occurrences are
        likely to occur in the dominant season.</para>
      <para>Consequently, events more frequent than 50% AEP should be expressed as X Exceedances per
        Year (EY). For example, 2 EY is equivalent to a design event with a 6 month recurrence
        interval when there is no seasonality in flood occurrence.</para>
      <para>Different users of Australian Rainfall and Runoff, in general, will use different
        segments of the relationship between flood magnitude and exceedance probability. To reduce
        confusion, that may arise from switching between different terminologies, it is recommended
        that consistent terminology in accordance with one of the columns of<xref linkend="arr_pref_term_table"/> be used within an industry segment.</para>
      <para>These expressions of estimated frequencies relate directly to the particular time period
        for which data have been analysed and frequencies determined with no consideration given to
        the long term effects of climatic change. Nonetheless, the adopted terminology is considered
        to be equally applicable to both stationary and non-stationary climatic environments, as
        there is no requirement for the annual exceedance probabilities to be constant over time.
        Consequently, where flood characteristics are changing as result of long term climatic
        change, the AEP of a flood characteristic for a future time period may be different or,
        conversely, a flood characteristic magnitude corresponding to a given AEP may change.</para>

    <title>Difference Between Design Events and Actual Events</title>
    <para>Much confusion has resulted from lack of recognition of the fundamental differences
      between these two types events and associated of flood estimation problems. Although the same
      mathematical procedures may be involved in both cases, the implications and assumptions
      involved, and the validity of application, are quite different. The emphasis in this document
      is largely on design floods.</para>
    <para>A design flood is a probabilistic or statistical estimate, being generally based on some
      form of probability analysis of flood or rainfall data. An Annual Exceedance Probability is
      attributed to the estimate. This applies not only to normal routine design, but also to
      probable maximum estimates, where no specific probability can be assigned but the intention is
      to obtain a design value with an extremely low probability of exceedance. In the flood
      estimation methods based on design rainfalls, the probability relationship between design
      rainfall events and design flood events is not a direct one. Occurrence of a rainfall
      eventwhen the catchment is wet might result in a very large flood, while occurrence of the
      same rainfall event when the catchment was dry might result in relatively little, or even no
      runoff. For the design situation, the combinations of different factors combining to produce a
      flood event are not known and must be assumed, often implicitly in the design values that are
      adopted.</para>
    <para>The approach to estimating an actual (or historic) flood from a particular rainfall event
      is quite different in concept and is of a deterministic nature. All causes and effects are
      directly related to the specific event under consideration. The actual antecedent conditions
      prevailing at the time of occurrence of the rain are directly reflected in the resulting flood
      and must be allowed for in its estimation. No real information on the probability of the on
      flood probability can be gained from consideration of a single actual flood event.</para>
    <para>Although the differences in these two types of events are often not recognised, they have
      three important practical consequences. The first is that a particular procedure might be
      might be appropriate for analysing actual flood events but quite unsuitable for probabilistic
      design flood events. </para>
    <para>The second concerns the manner in which values of parameters are derived from recorded
      data, and the manner in which designers regard these values and apply them. If actual floods
      are to be estimated, values for use in the calculations should be derived from calibration on
      individual observed events. If design floods are to be estimated, the values should be derived
      from statistical analyses of data from many observed floods.</para>
    <para>The third practical consequence concerns the manner in which parameters are viewed by
      designers and analysts. For example, design initial losses for bursts can be very different
      from event initial losses derived from actual events, yet practitioners still often compare
      them without understanding the differences.</para>

    <title>Probability Concepts</title>
    <section xml:id="b1_ch2_s_vmhn8">
      <title>Probability Relationship Between Design Rainfall and Design Flood
        Characteristics</title>
      <para>In the flood frequency based design flood estimation approaches covered in Book 3, the
        probabilities of a specific event magnitude being equalled or exceeded are estimated
        directly for the flood characteristic of interest (e.g. peak flow or flood volume). However,
        for the catchment simulation and hydrograph estimation procedures covered in Books 4, 5 and
        7, the exceedance probability associated with design rainfall, as the primary probabilistic
        input to the design flood estimation procedure, needs to preserved in its transformation to
        a design flood. This concept is often referred to as AEP neutrality. </para>
      <para>However, each of the processes represented in a model that converts rainfall to runoff
        and forms a flood hydrograph at the point of interest introduces some joint probability,
        resulting in the fundamental problem that the true probability of the derived flood
        characteristic may be obscure, and its magnitude may be biased with respect to the true
        flood magnitude with the same probability as the design rainfall, especially at the low
        probabilities of interest in design.</para>
      <para>Since publication of ARR87 (Pilgrim,1987) there has been a steady shift towards methods
        that better account for the stochastic nature of how floods of different magnitude and
        exceedance probabilities are generated. Procedures of different complexity to deal with this
        fundamental issue are discussed in Chapter 3.</para>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="b1_ch2_s_w5anx">
      <title>Choosing a Quantile Estimator</title>
      <para>The 1 in Y AEP quantile corresponds to the flood magnitude with annual probability of
        exceedance equal to 1/Y. Because the parameters of the flood frequency distribution have to
        be estimated from limited data, the true quantile is not known. Different quantile estimates
        are available depending on the application. These are described in Book 3, Chapter 2. </para>
      <para>In cases where the interest is principally on the accurate estimation of the AEP that
        corresponds to a specified flood magnitude (e.g. the flood level at which a particular flood
        protection structure is expected to fail), an expected AEP (or expected probability)
        quantile should be used. The use of such a quantile ensures that, on average, its AEP equals
        the true value. In cases where the mean-squared-error in the flood magnitude is to be
        minimized for a given AEP, expected parameter quantiles should be used. </para>
      <para>The difference between these quantile estimates is typically not of significance when
        there is little or no extrapolation of the observed range of data, and especially if the
        skew is small. However, if extrapolation is required and high skews are involved, the
        difference can be appreciable. The methods in Book 3, Chapter 2 describes how to estimates
        these quantiles.</para>

      <title>Avoiding Inconsistencies in Procedures and Resolution</title>
      <para>The important step often overlooked by practitioners is mistakenly using an input or
        parameter that was derived a particular way and at a particular resolution in a manner that
        is different to how it was derived. This is particularly difficult to avoid with digital
        data sets compiled from different sources and resolutions. Historically problems have arisen
        when a method was derived from one scale map and used at a different scale.[pew1]
        [pew1]Without giving a clear recommendation (e.g. It is the responsibility of practitioners
        to ensure that procedures and design data applied in a particular application are
        appropriate for the nature and location of their specific design problem) this section is of

      events can be understood, enabling risks to be assessed and where necessary managed. There is
      strong move from managing floods by a by simple standards approach, where a certain frequency
      of flooding is deemed acceptable, to risk-based approaches, where the consequence and

    <title>The Importance of Data</title>
    <para>Data is fundamental to flood estimation. Data is needed to understand the processes
      involved in the formation of floods and to ensure that models are accurate and reflect the
      real world issues being analysed. Flood estimation primarily uses data that describes the
      rainfall, streamflow and water levels. The procedures and guidelines presented in ARR could
      not have been developed without historical data, and often the reliability of the methods
      presented depends on the extent of data that has been used in development.</para>
    <para>For the first time, ARR has been based completely on Australian data to better reflect
      Australia’s variable landscape, including a national database of extreme flood hazards. A
      major task of the current ARR update was assembling a national databases of rainfall and
      streamflow data for developing inputs and methodologies. ARR 1987 used 600 pluviographs
      rainfall gauge (measures the amount of rainfall which fell) with greater than 6 years data and
      7500 daily rainfall gauges with over 30 years record. ARR 2016 uses almost 30 years of extra
      rainfall and streamflow data, including data from over 2200 pluviographs and over 8000 daily
      rainfall gauges. Over 900 streamflow gauges were analysed. Over 100, 000 storm events were
      analysed. This data provides a valuable resource for the development of future
      methodologies.</para>
    <para>Major improvements have been made to design flood estimation methods but national
      databases will allow the use and parameterisation of more complex methods. Major advances will
      continue that will allow us to leverage the limited data we can afford to collect on the
      continent nation. Many projects have opened the eyes of researchers and practitioners on what
      could be done with more time, money and the still limited data available. The data sets
      developed as part of this update should be enhanced and applied to for future

        the large-scale hydrological cycle including increasing atmospheric water vapour content;
        changing precipitation patterns, intensity and extremes; changes in soil moisture and
        runoff; and increasing melting of snow and ice (Bates et al., 2008).There is increasing
        evidence that human-induced climate change is changing precipitation extremes, and that
        extreme flooding globally has increased over the 20th century (Trenberth, 2011). There is
        confidence that these changes in the hydrological cycle will lead to increased variability
        in precipitation and increased frequency of flood events over many areas (IPCC 2007, Bates
        et al. 2008). Changes in climate will result in changes in the frequency, intensity, spatial
        extent, duration, and timing of extreme weather and climate events, and may lead to
        unprecedented extreme weather and climate events (IPCC, 2012).</para>

        <title>Climate Change Impacts on Rainfall</title>
        <para>Changes in extremes events, such as floods, can be linked to changes in the mean,
          variance, or shape of probability distributions, or all of these (IPCC, 2012). For
          example, climate change projections have shown that a relatively small shift in the
          distribution of precipitation may result in a large change in the frequency and magnitude
          of extreme precipitation events (Nicholls and Alexander, 2007). Studies have shown that a
          change in the shape of the distribution of precipitation is likely to have a greater
          effect on the frequency of extremes than a shift in the mean precipitation (White, 2010;
          Groisman et al. 1999), and that climate change is most likely to increase climate
          variability, particularly affecting the extremes (Jones et al., 2012; Fowler and Ekstrom,
          2009).</para>
        <para>A warming climate leads to an increase in the water holding capacity of the air, which
          causes an increase in the atmospheric water vapour that supplies storms, resulting in more
          intense precipitation. This effect is observed, even in areas where total precipitation is
          decreasing (Trenberth, 2011). Indeed, some of the largest impacts of climate change are
          likely to result from a shift in the frequency and strength of climatic extremes,
          including precipitation (White et al., 2010). It is likely that the frequency of heavy
          precipitation will increase by the end of the 21st century, particularly in the high
          latitudes and tropical regions and there is likely to be an increase in heavy rainfalls
          associated with tropical cyclones (IPCC, 2012).</para>
        <para>There have been many studies globally that have found increases in the intensity or
          frequency of extreme precipitation events (Bates et al., 2008; Westra et al., 2013). It is
          likely that since the 1970s the frequency of heavy precipitation events has increased over
          most areas (Bates, et al. 2008). From 1950 to 2005, extreme daily rainfall intensity and
          frequency has increased in north-western and central Australia and over the western
          tablelands of New South Wales, but decreased in the south-east and south-west and along
          the central east coast (CSIRO, 2007). Projections analysed by CSIRO (2007) showed that an
          increase in daily precipitation intensity is likely under climate change. The study found
          that the highest 1% of daily rainfalls tends to increase in the north of Australia and
          decrease in the south, with widespread increases in summer and autumn, but not in the
          south in winter and spring when there is a strong decrease in mean precipitation (CSIRO
          2007).</para>
        <para>The increases in precipitation are more evident in sub-daily rainfalls and major
          changes in the intensity and temporal patterns of sub-daily rainfalls can be expected by
          the end of the 21st century (Westra et al., 2013). In a study of downscaled outputs from
          climate models, Abbs and Rafter (2008) found that by 2070 the models projected an increase
          of an average of 40% in intensity for 24 and 72 hour events around the Queensland-New
          South Wales border, and an increase of more than 70% in the two hour rainfall events in
          the high terrain inland from the Gold Coast.</para>

        <title>Antecedent Conditions</title>
        <para>Changes in the patterns of precipitation and in evaporation will lead to changes in
          antecedent conditions prior to flood events, affecting soil moisture and thus loss rates
          in the catchment (Bates et. al., 2008). Potential evaporation is projected to increase
          almost everywhere on a global scale due to an increase in the water-holding capacity of
          the atmosphere with higher temperatures combined with little projected change in relative
          humidity (Bates et al. 2008).</para>
        <para>Projections of potential evapotranspiration over Australia show increases by 2030 and
          2070. The largest projected increases are in the north and east, where the change by 2030
          ranges from little change to a 6% increase, with the best estimate being a 2% increase. By
          2070, the A1FI scenario gives increases of 2% to 10% in the south and west with a best
          estimate of around 6%, and a range of 6% to 16% in the north and east with a best estimate
          around 10%. (CSIRO, 2007).</para>
        <para>Projected decreases in rainfall over much of Australia combined with increases in
          evaporation may result in disproportionate decreases in runoff due to a disconnection
          between surface and groundwater, as was experienced in parts of Australia during the
          Millennium drought (CSIRO, 2012).</para>

      <section xml:id="b1_ch2_s_o0gf8">
        <title>Sea Level</title>
        <para>The relatively small rise in sea level that is seen in observed data over the past
          century has already caused a significant change in the frequency of extreme sea-level
          events, and associated flooding (Hunter, 2007). Studies of observed sea level data
          worldwide have shown that sea level rise is the predominant cause of increases in the
          frequency of extreme sea level events (IPCC, 2007; Hunter, 2007). There is high confidence
          that there has been an increase in the frequency of high coastal sea level events of a
          given magnitude, and that extreme flooding events due to sea level rise will increase
          significantly, dependent on location (Church et al. 2012). The likely range of global-mean
          sea level rise between the 1980 – 1999 and 2090 – 2099 periods is given by IPCC (2007) as
          0.18 – 0.59 m. There is high confidence that the global rate of sea level rise has
          increased between the mid-19th and the mid-20th centuries. The average rate was 1.7 ± 0.5
          mm/yr for the 20th century and 3.1 ± 0.7 mm/yr for 1993–2003 (Bates et al., 2008). The
          observed rate of sea level rise in the Australian region from 1993 - 2011 has high spatial
          variability, with a maximum in the north and north-west coasts of Australia of 9mm/yr, and
          a rate of 2 to 4 mm/yr on the south-eastern and eastern Australian coastline (Church et
          al., 2012).</para>
