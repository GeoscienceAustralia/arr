    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>Floods can cause significant impacts where they interact with the community and the
      supporting natural and built environment. However, flooding also has the potential to be the
      most manageable natural disaster as the likelihood and consequences of the full range of flood
      events can be understood enabling risks to be assessed and where necessary managed.</para>
    <para>Design flood estimation plays a key role in understanding flood behaviour and how this may
      change with alterations within the floodplain and
      catchment<?oxy_insert_start author="testoni" timestamp="20151130T080850+1100"?> and with
      changes in climate and how these changes can influence both decision making on managing flood
      risk and the effective service life of infrastructure<?oxy_insert_end?>. Design flood
      estimation provide essential information on a range of key factors that need to be considered
      in understanding <?oxy_insert_start author="retallick" timestamp="20150908T122443+1000"?>and

      These include: flood frequency; flow rates, velocities and volumes; flood levels and extents;
      duration of inundation. ARR provides essential analytical tools to assist in estimating design
      floods and in understanding these
      factors.<?oxy_delete author="testoni" timestamp="20151130T080928+1100" content=" &lt;xref linkend=&quot;book3&quot;/&gt; provide relevant information on design flood estimation."?>

        <para>The establishment of design flood standards for infrastructure and as a basis for

          the use of a minimum floor levels for a building relative to a design flood level aims to

          <title>Design Flood Standard Terminology</title>
          <para>There are two key ways in which design flood standards are typically

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP): the likelihood of occurrence of a flood of
                a given size or larger in any one year; usually expressed as a percentage (e.g. a
                flood protection levee may adopt of Flood Design Standard that offers protection up
                to the a 1% AEP event);</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
              <para>Service Life Exceedance Probability (SLEP): The likelihood of exceedance during
                a project’s adopted service life, rather than as an annual likelihood. It is
                recommended that this should be the Effective Service Life
                (<?oxy_custom_start type="oxy_content_highlight" color="255,255,0"?>Section
                9)<?oxy_custom_end?>, rather than the Design Service Life.</para>

          </itemizedlist>
          <para>AUSTROADS, the national association of road transport and traffic authorities in
            Australia use both the SLEP approach and the AEP method depending on the context.</para>
          <para>The AEP method is used to define the levels of service of roads:</para>
          <para><quote>Freeways and arterial roads – should generally be designed to pass the 50 or
              100 year ARI flood without interruption to traffic. However for arterial roads in
              remote areas, a reduced standard is commonly adopted where traffic densities are low,
              AUSTROADS (1994).</quote></para>
          <para>The SLEP method is used in the design of bridges: </para>
          <para><quote>All bridges are to be designed so that they do not fail catastrophically
              during a flood that has a 5% chance of being exceeded during the Design Service Life
              of the structure. Assuming a 100 year Design Service Life, this equates to a flood
              with an ARI of 2000 years’ AUSTROADS (1994).</quote></para>
          <para>It is considered that while design standards are commonly expressed as an annual
            occurrence probability, it may be the case that stakeholders actually interpret and
            apply this more as a SLEP or an Exceedance Frequency over the adopted service life. For
            example, when stakeholders refer to a 1% AEP flood standard (floor level) for
            residential developments, conceptually they may interpret this to mean that the floor
            level for the property will only be exceeded once in every 100 years.</para>
          <para>The SLEP approach may be more readily understandable for short term or temporary

        <title>Analysis of the Impacts of Changing Development on Design Flood Estimates</title>
        <para>Future development within the catchment can have significant impacts on flood risk to
          the existing community. The impacts of development can be assessed by modifying the
          calibrated and validated models of existing flood behaviour to allow for changes to flow
          conveyance, storage and runoff conditions within the catchment. </para>
        <para>The natural flood functions of flow conveyance and flood storage occur in flow
          conveyance and flood storage areas. Filling of flow conveyance areas can impact upon
          upstream flood levels and can result in new flow paths being activated, affecting other
          areas. Filling of flood storage areas can affect both upstream and downstream flood
          levels. Any decision to modify the flow conveyance and flood storage characteristics of
          the floodplain need careful consideration as these ramifications can be significant. The
          significance of these impacts can be assessed by altering calibrated and validated models
          of existing conditions to allow for changes and assessing the associated impacts.
          Management of impacts can lead to modifying the changes in these areas in consideration of
          its impacts upon the community.</para>
        <para>Flows at a downstream point in the catchment can also change significantly with
          upstream development within the catchment, even where flow conveyance and flood storage
          areas maintain their essential flood functions. These changes can occur due to increase in
          impervious areas and flow paths being shortened or having a higher proportion of
          impervious area. This can reduce losses leading to a higher proportion of rainfall running
          off and the time of concentration of flows within the catchment being reduced. </para>
        <para>Assessment of the potential cumulative impacts of such broad changes is best
          undertaken in community rather than development scale flood investigations. It can provide
          the basis for understanding the relative significance of this change and where considered
          significant, assessing options to offset these impacts on a catchment basis. For example
          impacts on peak flood flows may, in some cases, be able to be managed using centralised or
          strategic scale basins or distributed (development site related) treatment measures.

          area will reduce flood damages for events up to but not exceeding the design flood event

      <para>The key difference between the two elements is that there will generally be two distinct

        suitable level of service (i.e. considering the acceptable degree of disruption to transport
        services for the route), as well as withstand an acceptable risk of damage from scour,
        submergence, or overtopping of structures. The consideration of disruption to transport

      <para>With short term projects, it is particularly important to understand the likelihood

        9). </para>
      <para>Flood design standards are typically developed for long term projects and are based on
        an assumed effective service life that is generally many years. For example, a residential
        house might have an effective service life of 50 years. Therefore, when a 1% AEP design
        flood standard is adopted for the floor level, for example, that is equivalent to an
        approximate 39% chance that the floor level will be exceeded during the effective service
        life (using a SLEP terminology, as identified in
        <?oxy_custom_start type="oxy_content_highlight" color="255,255,0"?>Section<?oxy_custom_end?>
        4.2.1). </para>
      <para>However, if a 1% AEP flood design level is adopted for a coffer dam for excavation for
        an effective service life of 6 months (i.e. a 6 month construction period), then the chance
        that it will be exceeded will be roughly 0.5% during its service life. Therefore, assuming
        that the consequences remain the same, then the risk profile is significantly more
        conservative. If a 39% chance of exceedance during its effective service life was assumed to
        be more appropriate, then that would be equivalent to somewhere between a 50% and a 100% AEP
        event.</para>
      <para>Therefore, a SLEP approach to flood design standards and flood levels can be more
        readily understandable for short term infrastructure.</para>
      <para>However, a full risk assessment will typically be required to understand all the
        likelihoods and consequences and therefore the risks. For example, the risk to life for a
        coffer dam may be significant where sufficient warning is not available.</para>

    <para>This can significantly alter the critical storm duration with the peak flood flow entering
      a basin likely to be derived from a shorter duration storm than the peak discharge flow from
      the basin. Storm pattern can also have a significant impact on basin operation and the storage
      volume available when the peak of flood flows arrives. For example, if the peak arrives later
      in the storm the available storage volume may be lower and therefore the basin may have less
      impact on downstream peak flows.</para>
    <para>In addition, critical storm durations are also likely to vary with the AEP of the flood
      being modelled. It is not unusual for the peak basin discharge in a more frequent flood than
      the design event to occur in a longer duration storm event as storm volumes are lower and the
      basin storage will have more impact upon peak discharge. However, for events larger than the
      design<?oxy_delete author="retallick" timestamp="20150909T140100+1000" content=" AEP"?> event
      the opposite is true. There is likely to be less storage volume available at the storm peak so
      it will have less influence on peak basin discharge. Therefore the critical downstream
      discharge from rarer events than the design
      <?oxy_delete author="retallick" timestamp="20150909T140116+1000" content="AEP "?>event will
      likely occur from shorter duration storms. For extreme events this is likely to be closer to
      the critical storm duration at the location without the basin.</para>
    <para>Therefore with a basin in place the peak downstream flood flow is sensitive to both the

        tropical climates than in sub-tropical climates. Similarly, pipes that lie below a water
        table typically have shorter service lives than pipes that lie above a water table. The rate
        of degradation of construction material (e.g. metal, plastic pipes) will also vary with
        circumstance (e.g. saline vs non-saline conditions). Maintenance and rehabilitation of

      <title>Literature</title>
      <para>There is a range of literature that discusses how changes over time non-stationarity can
        be applied in risk assessments. Much of the work to date has occurred in the academic space
        (such as those of Rootzen and Katz 2013, Astrom, et. al. 2013, and Salas &amp; Obeysekera,
        2014). This work indicates that there is potential for non-stationary models to be
        incorporated into design considerations and that the scale of catchment change may be of
        sufficient magnitude in some catchments to warrant consideration in design criteria.
        However, the costs of developing such models and assessments is likely to be prohibitive and
        unnecessary for the majority of flood- affected infrastructure, and that utilisation of
        traditional static risk profiles remains the more appropriate form of assessment. </para>
      <para>For example, a method for incorporating design flood standards and design life into risk
        assessments is presented in Rootzen and Katz (2013). The paper proposes two methods to
        quantify risk for engineering design in a changing climate:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>The Design Life Level aims to achieve a desired probability of exceedance (or risk
            of failure) during the Design Service Life. This method is a SLEP approach (Section 4);
            or</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>The Minimax Design Life Level is closely related, and complementary, but instead
            focuses on the maximal yearly probability of exceedance during the Design Service Life.
            This method is an AEP based approach.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>The Design Life Level uses a Generalised Extreme Value (GEV) cumulative distribution
        function (cdf) to present the extremes in year <emphasis role="italic">t</emphasis>, and
        with increasing location and scale parameters (the shape parameter is constant) related to
          <emphasis role="italic">t</emphasis>, the probability changes. The example likens the
        increase in location parameter to a possible increase in water level, and scale parameter to
        an increase in climate variability. Another parameter is also introduced, the Expected
        Waiting Time (EWT) - the amount of time until a particular level <emphasis role="italic"
          >u</emphasis> is exceeded. </para>
      <para>Under this approach, if what is considered an acceptable level of risk is constant, it
        may be desirable to design mitigation measures (e.g. Design Flood Standards) such that the
        likelihood of a given consequence is constant in time.

        1.18 (b) shows that if risk is increasing through time, then to keep the standard of risk
        protection constant, it would be necessary to continuously raise a defense. Clearly for many
        projects it is not possible to continually increase the capacity of flood protection
        measures, therefore if the mitigation measure is of fixed capacity the standard of risk
        protection varies with time

      <para>Similarly, Salas &amp; Obeysekera (2014) present a framework for addressing
        non-stationarity in risk assessment. The non-stationarity is considered in terms of
        increasing frequency of events, decreasing events and random shifting events, with standard
        return period and risk parameters. In the case of increasing extreme events, the exceedance
        probability of floods affecting structures also varies through time i.e. <emphasis

          >p</emphasis> will also be increasing

          with time (Salas &amp; Obeysekera, 2014)</emphasis></para>
      <para>This means that if the probability of the first flood exceeding the Design Flood
        Standard at time <emphasis role="italic">x</emphasis> = 1 is <emphasis role="italic"
          >p1</emphasis>, then the probability at time <emphasis role="italic">x</emphasis> = 2 is
          <emphasis role="italic">(1-p1) p2</emphasis>. In general, the probability that the first
        flood exceeding the Design Flood Standard will occur at time x is given by:</para>
      <para>
        <emphasis role="italic">f (x) = P (X = x) = (1-p1) (1-p2) (1-p3)…(1-px-1)
        px</emphasis></para>
      <para>This geometric distribution is developed further for application in a non-stationary
        framework to allow the waiting time for the first exceedance of the Design Flood Standard to
        be calculated. </para>
      <para>However, given the complexities of non-stationarity, the number of practical studies
        incorporating non-stationarity within flooding infrastructure is relatively low (e.g. Vogel
        et al. (2011), Condon et al. (2014), Ng et al. (2010) and Woodward et al. (2011)).
        Furthermore, there is limited application of these techniques in policy framework documents.
        In contrast, the majority of countries currently adopt coarse climate change adjustment
        factors to account for non-stationarity. Approaches within Australia are discussed in
        Chapter xx, with many assessments based upon considering a percentage increase in rainfall,
        ranging from 10 to 30% or examining the impacts of rarer flood events to test the
        sensitivity of flood behaviour to changes in flood flows relative to the existing
        conditions. Furthermore, the majority of guidance aims at providing advice in relation to
        one particular aspect, such as climate change impacts on flood producing rainfall events,
        rather than capturing all aspects of non-stationarity. </para>
      <para>However, there is broad guidance, such as AEMI (2013) that highlights the importance of
        considering how the floodplain and catchment will change overtime by encouraging both the
        understanding of cumulative impacts of new development and also considering the influence of
        a changing climate. These are generally undertaken separately to identify the sensitivity of
        changes due to these different changing factors. It is rare that all non-stationarity
        factors are considered together.</para>

      <title>Non-Stationary Risk Assessment</title>
      <para>Non-stationarity is typically included in community risk based assessments (Section 5)
        by considering catchment and floodplain changes and climate change in understanding and
        managing flood risk to a community. However, for other infrastructure, such as those
        identified in Sections 6 to 8, non-stationary factors may need to be considered for the
        assessment.</para>

        <title>Is a Non-Stationary Risk Assessment Required</title>
        <para>In general, uncertainty in risk likelihood and consequence increases with a project’s
          Effective Service Life. Some discussion on estimating effective service life are provided
          in Section 9. </para>
        <para>Once the effective service life has been determined an assessment of the potentially
          likelihood of changes to risk (likelihood or consequence factors) should be undertaken. A
          discussion on climate change, and whether this is important for consideration, is provided
          in <?oxy_custom_start type="oxy_content_highlight" color="255,255,0"?>Chapter

        <para>Where a reasonable risk of change in other sources of non-stationarity is identified,
          a non-stationary risk assessment may be a preferred risk assessment approach. While this
          can be difficult to evaluate the following broad guidance is provided: in general, for
          medium to long term infrastructure (i.e. with effective service life of greater than 5
          years), it is suggested that: </para>

            <para>If the effective service life is greater than 20 years but less than 50 years it

        <para>The above is a general guidance, and does not take into account project specific
          issues. For both short-term and long-term infrastructure it is recommended that an initial
          review be undertaken that evaluates whether or not changes in likelihood and/or
          consequence (as listed above) are likely to occur over the Effective Service Life of the
          project and considering whether such changes would impair the project’s ability to perform

        <title>Non-Stationary Risk Assessment</title>
        <para>Where non-stationary risk assessment is being considered, a process similar to
          non-stationary risk assessment can be undertaken. However, the non-stationary nature of
          the risks present will influence the design horizon over which the assessment is
          undertaken. </para>
        <para>Rather than adopt the more complex models identified in Section 5.2, it is recommended

              project’s ESL. By applying the risk assessment at T(max), and determining appropriate
              design criteria for this point, the proponent will effectively design its
              infrastructure to be acceptable at all points of its ESL. This is considered to be the
              most conservative approach and will lead to relative over-engineering of
              infrastructure at some points of its life, particularly early in its life. </para>

        <para>There may be thresholds or tipping points at which the frequency of flooding or the
          consequences (e.g. loss of life, damage to residential property) of that flooding or the
          associated risks are considered unacceptable to the community. If these can be identified
          they can provide a basis for considering the limit of tolerability (LoT). With knowledge
          of the anticipated rate of change in the likelihood or consequence of flood events over
          time, it may be possible to approximate the time at which the LoT will be exceeded for any
          one consequence. Based upon current understanding of any such limits, beyond this point,
          flooding in association with a given project may be considered generate unacceptable
          risks.</para>
        <para>This concept is basically a trigger based concept. For example, residential properties
          may be designed to a 1% AEP level, which is acceptable to the local authority. However,
          they are willing to tolerate a 2% AEP level if unavoidable. Currently, a residential
          development is built to a 1% AEP level. However, due to changes in the catchment (increase
          in impervious areas in the catchment) and climate change, this is expected to reduce to a
          2% AEP level after 30 years. This represents a trigger point at which time a mitigation
          measure may need to be implemented.</para>
        <para>Such points may be utilised as the minimum points at which risks, and the appetite for
          risk, are reassessed (T(0)a). Where current planning allows for adaptation, these can be
          considered the protected timeframe where this adaptation may be necessary based upon
          current knowledge and projections (T(x)

        <para>It is also noted that any option based around the future upgrade of infrastructure
          poses potential legal and commercial risks to both proponents and approval authorities.
          Given the extent of timeframe over which the infrastructure may be in place, the
          responsibility (and cost) of re-evaluation and upgrade in the future may change between
          individuals and there is the potential that the decision to upgrade at that time is not
          viable. In such circumstances the project may be decommissioned (these costs should be
          considered in any supporting economic analysis).</para>

      <title>Economic assessment</title>
      <para>For non-Stationary risk analysis, design options may be assessed through standard CBA
        evaluation of options. However, it is recommended that the changes over time be incorporated
        into the analysis. For example, the reduction in protection provided by a levee protecting a
        coastal town as flood levels change due to the increasing influence of coastal flooding as
        sea level rises due to climate change.</para>
      <para>A simple approach for incorporating the changes over time is to take two or more time
        slices. For example, the flood inundation damages are calculated in year 0 and at the end of
        the Effective Service Life. Then the damages are assumed to change linearly between these
        two points. If the change is expected to occur differently, the more time slices may be
        required.</para>

        5.3.2, the key change is that the Annual Average Damage will progressively change over the
        Effective Service Life of the project. This can then be included into the economic
        assessment as described in
        <?oxy_custom_start type="oxy_content_highlight" color="255,255,0"?>Section<?oxy_custom_end?>
        5.3.2.</para>
      <para>There are several key considerations in undertaking economic analysis in non-stationary
        conditions:</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="underline">Analysis
        Period</emphasis></emphasis></para>
      <para>The inclusion of non-stationarity results in benefits and costs that vary through time.
        The important implication of this is that an economic outcome can be dependent on when the
        economic analysis period commences. For example, if we pay to construct a levee now to
        protect against climate change, then the cost is incurred in the present, but no real
        benefit may be realised for some time, for example twenty years. When the time value of
        money is considered in this scenario, it may be worth not investing in the levee until
        twenty years have passed.</para>
      <para>This introduces a complication when comparing a number of alternative projects.
        Traditionally, you would be able to prioritise economically between projects based upon the
        larger BCR. However, the impact of non-stationarity introduces the dimension of time to the
        analysis. In other words, a project may not be viable now but may become viable in 10 years
        time. This type of assessment was applied in Thomson et al (2011) and Thomson et al (2012)
        for studies in the Solomon Islands.</para>
      <para>An economic analysis under non-stationary conditions should be expanded to incorporate
        variable option implementation timing (i.e. run CBA scenarios in which the project is
        developed in different phases over time). A CBA analysis could assess a range of scenarios
        (including staged scenarios) that capture this changing nature of costs and benefits over
        time.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="underline">Discount
        Rate</emphasis></emphasis></para>
      <para>A challenge of non-stationary factors like climate change is that impacts which are
        experienced further into the future are diluted by standard discount rates. There is
        significant research that has been undertaken on appropriate discount rates for very long
        time periods. This is based on the argument that intergenerational equity should be
        considered, and that future generations should not be unfairly weighted compared with
        existing generations (Stern, 2006). This becomes particularly important for projects which
        are expected to have a relatively long effective service life, and therefore the benefits
        will span across multiple generations. Some recent studies, such as the Stern Review (Stern,
        2006) have adopted very low discount rates (in the case of the Stern Review, 1.4%). </para>
      <para>Some economists argue for zero discount rates when applied to environmental impacts.
        Quiggin (1993) goes further and suggests that the use of zero discount rates is in agreement
        with sustainability, where </para>
      <para><quote>The interests of future generations should be given equal weight with our own in
          making decisions affecting the long term future</quote></para>
      <para>Farber et al. (1996) suggest </para>
      <para><quote>those changes that would enhance or degrade the human life support capacity of
          the ecosystem…. would not be discounted at all</quote></para>
      <para>Philibert (2003) reviewed a number of approaches, and discussed that the discount rate
        may be derived not from the consumer perspective, but on a more general society perspective,
        based on “interpersonal comparisons”. There are inherent difficulties with this analysis.
        Philibert (2003) argues that the current generation will incur costs for the benefit of
        future generations, but there will reach a point at which perceived gain for the next
        generation is not seen as worth the cost for the present generation. Therefore, a zero
        discount rate should not apply, as it would imply “very high investment by the present
        generation”. Philibert (2003) suggests a discount rate that decreases over time, approaching
        the “lowest reasonably foreseeable rate” of economic growth. Philibert (2003) also suggests
        potentially increasing the value of environmental assets, as these are progressively
        consumed moving into the future.</para>
      <para>Most of the discussion in relation to varying of discount rates focuses in on climate
        change and environmental policies. These policies, such as emission trading schemes, can
        result in costs now, in order to off-set potential significant costs in the future and
        impacts that may not be possible to be rectified by future generations.</para>
      <para>The challenge with varying the discount rate is that it results in difficulties in
        comparing across projects. For example, if one project adopts a discount rate of 7% and
        another a discount rate of 4%, then it is difficult to directly compare the BCR results of
        such studies without thoroughly understanding the underlying assumptions. </para>
      <para>For the purposes of the majority of water related infrastructure, and to ensure
        consistency across projects, it is recommended to adopt typical discount rates. Treasury
        guidance may recommend discount rates to provide consistency across competing projects.
        However, the above should be kept in mind for policies and planning that is targeting
        impacts well into the future.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold"><emphasis role="italic">Alternative Economic
          Models</emphasis></emphasis></para>
      <para>Alternatively, a more robust economic analysis approach would be the use of Real Options
        Analysis (ROA). ROA is a recognised approach to address the uncertainties of future
        conditions in flood risk management by accounting for flexibility in investment decision
        (World Bank, 2010; Short et al. 2012; Park et al. 2014, HM Treasury &amp; DEFRA, 2009). </para>
      <para>The standard CBA approach is a relatively coarse mechanism in which costs and benefits
        assessed are considered as a whole and do not allow for discernment of the manner in which
        they accrue (e.g. changes in the rate at which benefits are received may not justify
        development of all project components as part of initial project construction). Neither does
        the analysis recognise that estimates of cost, benefit and risk into the future are
        inherently uncertain. As such, deferring decisions on infrastructure investment until a
        later date when more information is available may be the preferred approach. ROA allows the
        value of deferring investment decisions to be assessed.</para>
      <para>In ROA, “options” represent predefined choices over a project’s Effective Service Life
        that strategically or operationally affects the course of the project. For example, a
        project may be to build a levee. If we build the levee in such a way that it is possible for
        it to be upgraded at a later date, a real option may be to increase levee height by 0.5m.
        The analysis defines decision points at which these choices are made (e.g. T(x)). The
        decision points can be points may be fixed in time or variable and triggered by internal or
        external events (e.g. occurrence of a 1% AEP event). Based on the Black-Scholes model
        utilised in financial options analysis, ROA utilises estimates of volatility (i.e. the
        likelihood of a particular flood event or level of damage occurring in one year) to evaluate
        expected values/damages that are likely to be incurred over the Effective Service Life. The
        establishment of appropriate volatility measures is critical to ROA, and not all systems
        will have readily discernible volatilities. </para>
      <para>For example, a flood levee may be required and it is known that currently it needs to be
        built to a 20% AEP in order to maintain an acceptable level of risk. However, it is also
        forecast that due to climate change, over 50 years, the magnitude of the 20% AEP event will
        be equivalent to the magnitude of the current 10% AEP event and that levee would need to be
        increased by one metre in height to provide the same level of risk. Assume, also that the
        volatility is such that there was 50% chance that the cost of flooding would increase by 5%
        per year and a 50% chance that the cost of flooding would increase by 1% per year. Utilising
        a numerical method for the pricing of options (e.g. the Binomial Method, Black-Scholes
        Model), and based on this volatility year on year, it would be possible to estimate the
        value of implementing an option in a given year (i.e. the value of waiting to make a
        decision on investing until more information is available). For example, if it turns out
        that by year 10 that there have been 10 consecutive 5% increases, then the benefits of
