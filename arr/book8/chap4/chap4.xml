    <title>General Considerations</title>
    <para>A loss model is needed to partition the design rainfall input into rainfall excess
      (runoff) and loss. General guidance on loss modelling for the types of loss models used in
      common practice is provided in <xref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"
        linkend="b5_ch5"/>. The following considerations and guidelines focus specifically on
      aspects of loss estimation related to the estimation of Very Rare to Extreme floods. The
      guidance is applicable to simulations undertaken using both deterministic and stochastic
      frameworks.</para>
    <para>The specific recommendations in <xref linkend="b8_s_kprjg"/> apply to loss parameters for
      the Initial Loss – Continuing Loss (IL-CL) model<emphasis role="italic">,</emphasis> as a
      large body of relevant experience has been accumulated over many years. However, other loss
      models may be used if they can be shown to be more appropriate in the specific
      situation.</para>

      <title>Importance of Design Losses – Very Rare to Extreme Events</title>
      <para>Like temporal patterns of rainfall, design losses are highly variable and can have an
        appreciable impact on both the peak flow and volume of the resulting flood. A given rainfall
        occurring on a dry catchment produces a significantly smaller flood than the same rainfall
        occurring on a wet catchment. For more frequent events, loss may be the most important
        factor. Joint probability approaches (e.g. <citation>b8_c_r80+1</citation>) are able to deal
        with the high variability of design losses better than the design event approach, as they
        use a probability distribution of loss values, rather than a single ‘representative value’.
        (‘Representative’ means that the selected design loss values should ensure a ‘probability
        neutral’ transformation of the design rainfall input of a given AEP into a design flood
        output of the same AEP). However, the impact of the inter-event variability of losses and
        the relative importance of losses diminishes with decreasing AEP, and for Extreme events it
        is likely that losses are of lesser importance than temporal patterns. For the estimation of
        Very Rare to Extreme floods, the use of single-value representative design losses may be
        adequate, though when simulating long duration events for volume-dependent problems it may
        be appropriate to adopt stochastic approaches as discussed in <xref linkend="b8_s_gncno"
        />.</para>
      <para>For extreme rains and floods, a much greater proportion of a catchment may become
        saturated during the event than is the case for most floods in the observed range. Also,
        during extreme rainfalls, vegetation may be stripped from the catchment, thus resulting in
        an increase in the volume and speed of the overland flow component of runoff
          <citation>b8_c_r28</citation>. Any evidence relevant to the changed behaviour of the
        catchment under extreme rainfall conditions should be considered when estimating design
        losses and the resulting design floods.</para>

      <title>Losses Associated With Design Storms and Design Bursts</title>
      <para>When considering the adoption of design losses it is necessary to understand the
        distinction between <emphasis role="italic">design bursts</emphasis> of rainfall, and
          <emphasis role="italic">design storms</emphasis>. The difference between the two concepts
        and the implications of the two concepts for the estimation of design losses are explained
        in <xref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" linkend="b5_ch5_s_wuhr9"/>. The
        selection of design loss values must take into consideration the manner in which the design
        information was derived, and whether the losses are to be applied to design storms or design
        bursts. More specifically, there is a significant difference between the initial loss values
        applicable to design storms and

        bursts, and how these loss values can be expected to vary with event magnitude (see <xref

    <section xml:id="b8_s_wzey8">
      <title>Variation of Loss Values with Event Magnitude</title>
      <para>Different loss models will behave differently when extrapolated to Extreme events, as
        they introduce differing degrees of non-linearity into the transfer between design rainfalls
        and the resulting hydrograph. Thus, even if different loss models are able to reproduce
        calibration events equally well, adoption of the same loss parameters for derivation of
        Extreme design floods may produce significantly different design flood hydrographs. For
        example, a specific set of loss parameters for the Initial Loss – Continuing Loss (IL-CL)
        and Initial Loss – Proportional Loss (IL-PL) models may yield similar flood peaks for the 1
        in 100 AEP design event, but if the same parameters were retained to derive the 1 in
          10<superscript>6</superscript> AEP flood, the different loss models would produce markedly
        different design flood hydrographs. The impact of model structure on the extrapolation of
        loss parameters for application to Very Rare to Extreme events must thus be carefully
        considered.</para>
      <para>The discussion in <xref linkend="b5_ch5_s_oj30q"/> makes it clear that Storm Initial
        Loss (IL<subscript>s</subscript>) and Burst Initial Loss (IL<subscript>b</subscript>) are
        expected to show a different degree of variation with event magnitude. The two types of
        initial loss for rural catchments are therefore treated separately in <xref
          linkend="b8_s_dmjaz"/> and <xref linkend="b8_s_v7t6m"/>.</para>

        unsaturated proportion of the

        implies that with larger storm events the unsaturated proportion of the catchment is
        reducing and thus the proportional loss also reduces. As it is difficult to extrapolate the
        rate of this reduction to Extreme events, the proportional loss model is generally
        considered less appropriate for estimating Very Rare to Extreme floods. On the other hand,
        the <emphasis role="italic">Continuing Loss </emphasis> (CL) is expected to approach a
        limiting value for saturated catchment conditions, and this limiting value is the
        appropriate design loss rate for all events for which the saturation threshold has been
        exceeded. More detailed discussion of the variation of CL with event magnitude for rural
        catchments is given in <xref linkend="b8_s_mq2w3"/>.</para>

          <title>Storm Initial Loss (IL<subscript>s</subscript>)</title>
          <para>The available evidence to support the conceptual interpretation of loss variation
            includes the results obtained by <citation>b8_c_r19+1</citation>; these indicated little
            or no variation of design losses with rainfall severity for events more frequent than 1
            in 100 AEP. For IL<subscript>s</subscript>, this finding implies little or no
            correlation between the magnitudes of pre-storm rainfall (producing the storm antecedent
            conditions) and storm event rainfall for events more frequent than 1 in 100 AEP.</para>
          <para>An analysis of the rainfall conditions prior to the largest storms on record in the
            GSAM region of south-eastern Australia <citation>b8_c_r42</citation> indicated
            qualitatively no propensity for “greater than normal” rainfall in the 15 days
            immediately preceding these large storms. The analysis by <citation>b8_c_r42</citation>
            shows that about 75% of the largest storms on record in south-eastern Australia were
            preceded by rainfall totals of less than 10% of the depth of the storm. Further, the
            analysis revealed that the average length of the dry period between pre-storm rainfall
            and the storms was about 8 days.</para>
          <para>The available evidence thus suggests that there is no need to vary
              IL<subscript>s</subscript> with event magnitudes up to the largest event on record.
            Further research is desirable to confirm the applicability of these findings of little
            or no variation of IL<subscript>s</subscript> with event magnitude to regions outside
            south-eastern Australia.</para>

          <para>The pre-burst rainfall (the rainfall from the beginning of the complete storm to the
            start of the design rainfall burst), rather than the pre-storm rainfall, is the key
            determinant of Burst Initial Loss, IL<subscript>b</subscript>, as it results in
            different degrees of catchment saturation. IL<subscript>b</subscript> is thus
            systematically smaller than IL<subscript>s</subscript>; the difference decreasing with
            increasing burst duration, reflecting a tendency for long duration bursts to represent
            complete storms. As an increasing storm magnitude is generally also associated with
            larger pre-burst rainfall, IL<subscript>b</subscript> tends to further decrease with

          <title>Continuing Loss (CL)</title>
          <para>For events of increasing duration and intensity of rainfall, an increasing
            proportion of the catchment is expected to become saturated, resulting in a reduced
            catchment average value of Continuing Loss, CL. However, the available evidence from
              <citation>b8_c_r19+1</citation>, based on catchments located in Victoria and the ACT,
            indicates no systematic differences in CL for observed events between 1 in 2 to 1 in 100
            AEP. This can be interpreted to mean that, except in catchments with highly pervious
            soils, catchment saturation is approached already during moderate to large storm events.
            Nevertheless, it should be conservatively assumed that only the CL values associated
            with the largest observed events are representative of design loss rates for Very Rare

        this can be readily explained by differences in the likelihood of pre-storm rainfall for
        different seasons. However, the interpretation of the observed seasonal differences in
        continuing losses is more difficult. Little published information is available on seasonal
        loss values suitable for design, and efforts should be made to seek out relevant regional
        information where available. Where there is clear evidence of seasonal differences in

        minimise bias in the transformation of rainfalls to floods. In the extreme range of floods

        <para>Very low values of IL<subscript>b</subscript> are recommended as it is assumed that
          the pre-burst rainfalls associated with the PMP design burst will either partly (longer
          duration bursts) or fully (short duration bursts) satisfy soil moisture deficits. In
          conformity with the adopted policy of aiming for reasonable conservatism in the absence of
          more relevant information, conservatively low estimates are generally recommended. For PMP
          design burst durations approaching the duration of the observed storms, the
            IL<subscript>b</subscript> value for use with the PMP should be equal to or possibly a
          little less than the minimum IL<subscript>b</subscript> value in large floods observed on
          the catchment. For significantly shorter burst durations, a zero value for

        <para>In this context of selecting a design loss, some care and interpretation may be
          required in assessing the minimum value in observed floods. Sometimes an apparently

          could have resulted from the effects of data errors, it may be desirable to neglect the

        <title>Probable Maximum Precipitation Flood</title>
        <para>General guidelines regarding the CL values to be used with PMP design bursts are given
          for various regions of Australia, based on published data or local experience. With the
          general nature of the recommendations, it is not appropriate to delineate precise
          boundaries of the regions. Where possible, greatest reliance should be placed on values
          derived from several large observed floods on the catchment of interest, as discussed
          previously (<xref xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" linkend="b5_ch5_s_e5fbn"/>).
          Given the tendency of events of greater rainfall intensity to saturate greater proportions
          of the catchment, the largest events are expected to be associated with the smallest loss
          rates. Similarly, long duration events can be expected to be associated with lower CL
          values than short duration events. However,  any anomalously low values, thought to result
          from the effects of data errors in the volume balance computations, should be
          neglected.</para>
        <para>For short duration events, losses are very small compared with depths of
          precipitation, and variations in the value adopted will have little effect on the
          magnitude of the resulting flood. For longer storms, the rate of loss and the form of loss
          adopted can have a considerable effect on estimated floods, particularly on flood volumes,
          and greater care is needed in their selection. An example of the variation of maximum pond
          level with loss values is given by <citation>b8_c_r6+1</citation>.</para>
