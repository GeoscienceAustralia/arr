                     design of major infrastructure (e.g. roads, bridges, and railways). The
                     assessment of flood risk is of particular importance to the safe design,
                     maintenance and operation of dams. The safety and economic implications of

                     are intended to provide a clear statement of what constitutes best practice in
                     sufficient detail to enable the procedures to be applied to practical problems.
                     Best practice in this field is constantly evolving, and thus these

                     focus on the general principles that should be considered when estimating
                     extreme floods rather on the detailed description of prescriptive procedures.

                     are aimed at practitioners with some experience in the field, rather than at
                     people new to extreme flood estimation. Worked examples are provided to
                     illustrate some of the design concepts involved, but overall the thrust is to
                     state what best practice is, not to explain in detail how to achieve it.</para>

                            analysis and the degree of uncertainty associated with it, varies with
                            flood magnitude. The notional event classes of most relevance to <xref

                            adopted classes represent a continuum of increasing uncertainty rather
                            than discrete intervals. The estimation procedures and design data

                            flood consequences within the range of uncertainty, then the likely
                            range of outcomes must be explicitly considered in a risk management

                     <para>The class of Rare events is intended to represent those events for which
                            direct observations relevant to the site of interest are generally
                            available. The most common sources of information for this range of
                            floods are the systematic records of rainfalls or streamflow (available
                            either at the site of interest or else transposed from similar
                            catchments), though they include historic information for notable events
                            that occurred prior to the beginning of continuous gauged records.
                            Accessible records in general only extend back to the past 100 years,
                            and thus notionally the AEPs corresponding to this category are limited
                            to events more frequent than 1 in

                     <para>The credible limit of extrapolation is dependent upon the nature of
                            available data that can be obtained at and/or transposed to the site of
                            interest. Procedures are often used which are based on “trading space
                            for time”, in which data from several sites are used to help inform the
                            estimation of exceedance probabilities at a single site. The
                            defensibility of this form of extrapolation depends on the strength of
                            the assumptions made, particularly those relating to the assumed degree
                            of similarity between the sites used in the regional pooling. It is
                            important to realise that in any given region the credible limit of
                            rainfall extrapolation may well differ from the limit applicable to
                            floods.</para>

                     <para>Extreme floods, the third class, represent the range of floods which
                            borders on the “unknowable”, where even a high level of expertise cannot
                            reduce the level of uncertainty substantially. Estimates of such events
                            lie beyond the credible limit of extrapolation, but are hopefully based
                            on our broadest understanding of the hydrometeorological and catchment
                            processes governing flood production, including their physical limits.
                            It should be recognised that our understanding of catchment processes is
                            largely based on observations of relatively frequent floods, and it is
                            possible that a catchment may change its behaviour when subjected to
                            extreme rainfalls.</para>
                     <para>Any extensions beyond the credible limit of extrapolation should employ a
                            consensus approach that provides consistent and reasonable values for
                            pragmatic design. The procedures relating to this range of estimates
                            should be regarded as inherently prescriptive, as without empirical
                            evidence or scientific justification there can be no rational basis for
                            departing from the consensus approach.</para>
                     <para>The level of uncertainty of these estimates can only be reduced by
                            long-term fundamental research.

                            it is important that the procedures related to this class of floods be
                            reviewed periodically to ensure that any advances in our understanding
                            of extreme hydrological and hydrometeorological processes are
                            incorporated into design practice.</para>

                                          hydrograph models is generally focused on those issues
                                          that most need to be considered when extrapolating to
                                          conditions well beyond those encountered during
                                          calibration to observed floods. While in general these
                                          considerations encourage a sound understanding of model
                                          features, they are less important if the models are
                                          applied to event magnitudes and conditions similar to
                                          those applicable during calibration.</para>

                            (AEP) rather than estimates of flood magnitude. This approach is also
                            generally recommended for Very Rare to Extreme flood events. However, as
                            the PMF event cannot be assigned a specific AEP, design for the PMF does
                            not lend itself to a risk-based approach, and a standards based approach
                            must be adopted instead. This is discussed further in <xref

                            of ‘reasonableness’ is advocated.</para>
