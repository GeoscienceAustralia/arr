              <title>Scope and Intent of the Book</title>
              <para>In the past two decades, there has been an increasing focus  on the derivation
                     of floods with very low probabilities of exceedance (often termed very
                     <?oxy_comment_start author="retallick" timestamp="20160426T194845+1000" comment="our new terms- is this very rare?"?>rare<?oxy_comment_end?>
                     flood events). Information on these floods is required in many aspects of civil
                     engineering, including floodplain management and the design of major
                     infrastructure (e.g. roads, bridges, and railways). The assessment of flood
                     risk is of particular importance to the safe design, maintenance, and operation
                     of dams. The safety and economic implications of these flood estimates
                     accentuate the desirability of using similar or compatible procedures by all
                     Australian authorities and designers.</para>
              <para>The floods under consideration in this Book are events with an Annual Exceedance
                     Probability (AEP) of between 1 in 100 and 1 in 10<superscript>7</superscript>.
                     The emphasis of this Book is on the estimation of a flood frequency curve
                     between these limits as inputs to risk-based design rather than on the
                     estimation of a design flood of specific AEP and/or magnitude. The absolute
                     upper limit of flood magnitude under consideration is the Probable Maximum
                     Flood (PMF), which is a design concept that cannot be readily assigned an
                     AEP.</para>
              <para>These Guidelines are intended to provide a clear statement of what constitutes
                     best practice in sufficient detail to enable the procedures to be applied to
                     practical problems. Best practice in this field is constantly evolving, and
                     thus this Book focuses on the general principles that should be considered when
                     estimating extreme floods rather on the detailed description of prescriptive
                     procedures. It should be noted that this Book is aimed at practitioners with
                     some experience in the field, rather than at people new to extreme flood
                     estimation. Worked examples are provided to illustrate some of the design
                     concepts involved, but overall the thrust is to state what best practice is,
                     not to explain in detail how to achieve it.</para>

                            increase with increasing <?oxy_comment_end?>size of the flood (or
                            reducing AEP). The type of available information, and hence the nature
                            of procedure that can be used in the analysis and the degree of
                            uncertainty associated with it, varies with flood magnitude. The
                            notional event classes of most relevance to <xref linkend="book8"/> are
                            summarised in <xref linkend="b8_f_1hza4"/>, which represent the more
                            extreme classes of events discussed in <xref linkend="b1_ch3"/>. This
                            figure broadly divides the floods and rainfalls of interest into Rare,
                            Very Rare, and Extreme ranges, but the adopted classes represent a
                            continuum of increasing uncertainty rather than discrete intervals. The
                            estimation procedures and design data discussed in <xref linkend="book8"
                            /> relate specifically to the Very Rare and Extreme event
                            classes.</para>
                     <para>These Guidelines are intended to provide practitioners with an approach
                            that yields estimates in the mid-range of the notional uncertainty band
                            indicated in <xref linkend="b8_f_1hza4"/>, and it is recommended that
                            this ‘best estimate’ be adopted rather than a value at the limits of the
                            uncertainty band. Nevertheless, if there are significant differences in
                            flood consequences within the range of uncertainty, then the likely
                            range of outcomes must be explicitly considered in a risk management
                            framework when developing flood management strategies.</para>

                            designers and academics from around Australia. They therefore constitute
                            recommended best practice. Innovation and trialling of new techniques
                            based on additional research (with peer review) is strongly encouraged
                            for the estimation of Very Rare to Extreme floods but the pragmatic
                            nature of procedures requires an increasing level of prescription as
                            estimates extend beyond the credible limit of extrapolation. Details

                            direct observations relevant to the site of interest are generally
                            available. The most common sources of information for this range of
                            floods are the systematic records of rainfalls or streamflow (available
                            either at the site of interest or else transposed from similar
                            catchments), though they include historic information for notable events
                            that occurred prior to the beginning of continuous gauged records.

                            and thus notionally the AEPs corresponding to this category are limited
                            to events more frequent than 1 in

                            AEP, for convenience the lower limit of AEP associated with Rare floods
                            is assumed to be 1 in 100 AEP.<?oxy_comment_end?></para>

                            estimates within this range, and the associated degree of uncertainty in
                            the estimates can be readily quantified.</para>

                     <para>The credible limit of extrapolation is dependent upon the nature of
                            available data that can be obtained at and/or transposed to the site of
                            interest. Procedures are often used which are based on “trading space
                            for time”, in which data from several sites are used to help inform the
                            estimation of exceedance probabilities at a single site. The
                            defensibility of this form of extrapolation depends on the strength of
                            the assumptions made, particularly those relating to the assumed degree
                            of similarity between the sites used in the regional pooling. It is
                            important to realise that in any given region the credible limit of
                            rainfall extrapolation may well differ from the limit applicable to
                            floods.</para>

                            situations, though in most cases the credible AEP limits are likely to
                            be considerably closer to the typical estimates than the most optimistic
                            bounds. At present in Australia rainfall regionalisation procedures
                            yield credible limits of extrapolation of around 1 in 2000 AEP
                                   <citation>b8_c_r95</citation>, though when larger regions are
                            considered within a joint probability framework, the limit can be
                            extended (with considerable uncertainty) out to limits that are one to
                            two orders of magnitude rarer <citation>b8_c_r52</citation>.</para>
                     <para>The analyses required to extrapolate estimates to the credible limit
                            require substantial resources and a high level of specialist expertise,
                            and they are thus generally beyond the level of resources available to a
                            single study. Practitioners will usually need to rely on processed
                            information prepared specifically for the region of interest. There is
                            considerable scope for innovation and trialling of new estimation
                            techniques for this class of events to reduce the uncertainty of the
                            estimates and perhaps extend the limit of extrapolation. However,
                            adoption of new estimation approaches will depend on the outcome of
                            detailed peer review.</para>

                     <title>Extreme Events</title>
                     <para>Extreme floods, the third class, represent the range of floods which
                            borders on the 'unknowable', where even a high level of expertise cannot
                            reduce the level of uncertainty substantially. Estimates of such events
                            lie beyond the credible limit of extrapolation, but are hopefully based
                            on our broadest understanding of the hydrometeorological and catchment
                            processes governing flood production, including their physical limits.
                            It should be recognised that our understanding of catchment processes is
                            largely based on observations of relatively frequent floods, and it is
                            possible that a catchment may change its behaviour when subjected to
                            extreme rainfalls.</para>
                     <para>Any extensions beyond the credible limit of extrapolation should employ a
                            consensus approach that provides consistent and reasonable values for
                            pragmatic design. The procedures relating to this range of estimates
                            should be regarded as inherently prescriptive, as without empirical
                            evidence or scientific justification there can be no rational basis for
                            departing from the consensus approach.</para>
                     <para>The level of uncertainty of these estimates can only be reduced by
                            long-term fundamental research. Accordingly, it is important that the
                            procedures related to this class of floods be reviewed periodically to
                            ensure that any advances in our understanding of extreme hydrological
                            and hydrometeorological processes are incorporated into design
                            practice.</para>

                                   <citation>b8_c_r61</citation>. Book 6
                            r<?oxy_comment_end?>epresented a shift in emphasis away from a
                            standards-based design approach to a risk-based one, in which the focus
                            of interest is on deriving design flood estimates of specified Annual
                            Exceedance Probability (AEP) rather than estimates of flood magnitude.
                            This approach is also generally recommended for Very Rare to Extreme
                            flood events. However, as the PMF event cannot be assigned a specific
                            AEP, design for the PMF does not lend itself to a risk-based approach,
                            and a standards based approach must be adopted instead. This is
                            discussed further in <xref linkend="b8_s_gbk9t"/>, where an objective
                            basis for the concept of ‘reasonableness’ is advocated.</para>
