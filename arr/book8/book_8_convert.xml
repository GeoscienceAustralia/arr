      <title>Scope and Intent of the Guidelines</title>

      <para>In the past two decades, there has been an increasing focus of
      attention on the derivation of floods with very low probabilities of
      exceedance. Information on these floods is required in many aspects of
      civil engineering, including floodplain management and the design of
      major infrastructure (e.g. roads, bridges, and railways). The assessment
      of flood risk is of particular importance to the safe design,
      maintenance and operation of dams. The safety and economic implications
      of these flood estimates accentuate the desirability of using similar or
      compatible procedures by all Australian authorities and
      designers.</para>

      <para>The floods under consideration in this Book are events with an
      annual exceedance probability (AEP) of between 1 in 100 and 1 in
      10<superscript>7</superscript>. The emphasis of these guidelines is on
      the estimation of a flood frequency curve between these limits as inputs
      to risk-based design rather than on the estimation of a design flood of
      specific AEP and/or magnitude. The absolute upper limit of flood
      magnitude under consideration is the probable maximum flood (PMF), which
      is a design concept that cannot be readily assigned an AEP.</para>

      <para>These guidelines are intended to provide a clear statement of what
      constitutes best practice in sufficient detail to enable the procedures
      to be applied to practical problems. Best practice in this field is
      constantly evolving, and thus these guidelines focus on the general
      principles that should be considered when estimating extreme floods
      rather on the detailed description of prescriptive procedures. It should
      be noted that these guidelines are aimed at practitioners with some
      experience in the field, rather than at people new to extreme flood
      estimation. Worked examples are provided to illustrate some of the
      design concepts involved, but overall the thrust is to state what best
      practice is, not to explain in detail how to achieve it.</para>

          National Committee on Large Dams (ANCOLD, 2000) provides
          recommendations on most aspects of spillway provision and safety
          levels for all potentially hazardous structures which store water or
          other liquids, including flood retarding basins, service basins and
          tailings dams. The recommended design floods range in AEP from 1 in
          100 to 1 in 10<superscript>7</superscript>. The ANCOLD guidelines
          focus on design considerations of such structures, and refer to
          these guidelines for the hydrologic procedures involved.</para>

          referable dam categories and thus be subject to its recommendations.
          Even when this does not apply, it may be desirable to check the
          performance of a detention basin for the consequences of a very
          large or extreme flood, where the structure is located in a
          populated area and if failure could endanger lives or property. This
          may apply particularly where a series of structures is constructed
          on a watercourse and progressive failure could occur. Detention
          basins are discussed further in <xref linkend="book9"/>.</para>

          <para><emphasis role="italic">Urban trunk drainage</emphasis>: While
          these drains generally are not designed to carry extreme floods,

          supply intakes and sewage treatment plants where flood damage could
          cause severe disruption to a community, flat roofs where blockage of

        <title>General Limits</title>

        <para>The procedures recommended here are based on the recognition
        that the uncertainties involved with the flood estimation process
        increase with increasing size of flood (or reducing AEP). The type of
        available information, and hence the nature of procedure that can be
        used in the analysis and the degree of uncertainty associated with it,
        varies with flood magnitude. The notional event classes of most
        relevance to Book 8 are summarised in <xref linkend="b8_f_1hza4"/>,
        which represent the more extreme classes of events discussed in <xref
        linkend="b1_ch3"/>. This figure broadly divides the floods and
        rainfalls of interest into Rare, Very Rare, and Extreme ranges, but
        the adopted classes represent a continuum of increasing uncertainty
        rather than discrete intervals. The estimation procedures and design
        data discussed in Book 8 relate specifically to the Very Rare and
        Extreme event classes.</para>

        <para>These guidelines are intended to provide practitioners with an
        approach that yields estimates in the mid-range of the notional
        uncertainty band indicated in <xref linkend="b8_f_1hza4"/>, and it is
        recommended that this ‘best estimate’ be adopted rather than a value
        at the limits of the uncertainty band. Nevertheless, if there are
        significant differences in flood consequences within the range of
        uncertainty, then the likely range of outcomes must be explicitly
        considered in a risk management framework when developing flood
        management strategies.</para>

        <para>The procedures presented herein have been reviewed by
        experienced designers and academics from around Australia. They
        therefore constitute recommended practice. Innovation and trialling of
        new techniques based on additional research (with peer review) is
        strongly encouraged for the estimation of Very Rare to Extreme floods
        but the pragmatic nature of procedures requires an increasing level of
        prescription as estimates extend beyond the credible limit of
        extrapolation. Details concerning the characteristics of each event
        class are provided below.</para>

        <title>Rare Events</title>

        <para>The class of Rare events is intended to represent those events
        for which direct observations relevant to the site of interest are
        generally available. The most common sources of information for this
        range of floods are the systematic records of rainfalls or streamflow
        (available either at the site of interest or else transposed from
        similar catchments), though they include historic information for
        notable events that occurred prior to the beginning of continuous
        gauged records. Accessible records in general only extend back to the
        past 100 years, and thus notionally the AEPs corresponding to this
        category are limited to events more frequent than 1 in 100. Given that
        guidance provided elsewhere in ARR is generally restricted to events
        with AEPs equal to or more frequent than 1 in 100, for convenience the
        lower limit of AEP associated with Rare floods is assumed to be 1 in
        100.</para>

        <para>The procedures relevant to the analysis of this type of
        information are largely covered by the Books related to rainfall and
        flood frequency analysis, and rainfall-runoff routing (<xref
        linkend="book2"/>; <xref linkend="book4"/>; and <xref linkend="book5"/>). However, given that
        this range of events is often used to “anchor” the lower end of
        frequency curves used to extrapolate to extreme events, some mention
        of their estimation is retained in this book.</para>

        <para>The analyses are based on deriving design flood estimates that
        lie within the upper range of direct observations, and thus generally
        involve some degree of extrapolation. A large body of experience and a
        great variety of procedures are available to help the practitioner
        derive flood estimates within this range, and the associated degree of
        uncertainty in the estimates can be readily quantified.</para>

        <title>Very Rare Floods</title>

        <para>Very Rare floods represent the range of events between the
        largest direct observations and the <emphasis role="bold"><emphasis
        role="italic">credible limit of extrapolation</emphasis></emphasis>.
        With reference to the latter concept, it is worth noting that the
        term:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>“credible” is used to represent the justifiable limit of
            extrapolation without the use of other confirming information from
            an essentially independent source; and,</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>“extrapolation” is used to denote estimates that are made
            outside the range of observations available at a single
            site.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>The credible limit of extrapolation is dependent upon the nature
        of available data that can be obtained at and/or transposed to the
        site of interest. Procedures are often used which are based on
        “trading space for time”, in which data from several sites are used to
        help inform the estimation of exceedance probabilities at a single
        site. The defensibility of this form of extrapolation depends on the
        strength of the assumptions made, particularly those relating to the
        assumed degree of similarity between the sites used in the regional
        pooling. It is important to realise that in any given region the
        credible limit of rainfall extrapolation may well differ from the
        limit applicable to floods.</para>

        <para>The notional credible limits of extrapolation for a range of
        data types in Australia are shown in <xref linkend="b8_t_tbdlw"/>
        (modified after USBR, 1999). This table indicates the lower AEP bound
        corresponding to both typical and the most optimistic situations,
        though in most cases the credible AEP limits are likely to be
        considerably closer to the typical estimates than the most optimistic
        bounds. At present in Australia rainfall regionalisation procedures
        based on trading space for time yield credible limits of extrapolation
        of around 1 in 2000 AEP (Nandakumar et al, 2012), though when larger
        regions are considered within a joint probability framework, the limit
        can be extended (with considerable uncertainty) out to limits that are
        one to two orders of magnitude rarer (Nathan et al, 2015).</para>

        <para>The analyses required to extrapolate estimates to the credible
        limit require substantial resources and a high level of specialist
        expertise, and they are thus generally beyond the level of resources
        available to a single study. Practitioners will usually need to rely
        on processed information prepared specifically for the region of
        interest. There is considerable scope for innovation and trialling of
        new estimation techniques for this class of events to reduce the
        uncertainty of the estimates and perhaps extend the limit of
        extrapolation. However, adoption of new estimation approaches will
        depend on the outcome of detailed peer review.</para>

        <title>Extreme Floods</title>

        <para>Extreme floods, the third class, represent the range of floods
        which borders on the “unknowable”, where even a high level of
        expertise cannot reduce the level of uncertainty substantially.
        Estimates of such events lie beyond the credible limit of
        extrapolation, but are hopefully based on our broadest understanding
        of the hydrometeorological and catchment processes governing flood
        production, including their physical limits. It should be recognised
        that our understanding of catchment processes is largely based on
        observations of relatively frequent floods, and it is possible that a
        catchment may change its behaviour when subjected to extreme
        rainfalls.</para>

        <para>Any extensions beyond the credible limit of extrapolation should
        employ a consensus approach that provides consistent and reasonable
        values for pragmatic design. The procedures relating to this range of
        estimates should be regarded as inherently prescriptive, as without
        empirical evidence or scientific justification there can be no
        rational basis for departing from the consensus approach.</para>

        <para>The level of uncertainty of these estimates can only be reduced
        by long-term fundamental research. Accordingly it is important that
        the procedures related to this class of floods be reviewed
        periodically to ensure that any advances in our understanding of
        extreme hydrological and hydrometeorological processes are
        incorporated into design practice.</para>

        scope and procedures presented in Chapter 13 of the 3rd edition of ARR
        (Pilgrim and Rowbottom, 1987). Book VI represented a shift in emphasis
        away from a standards-based design approach to a risk-based one, in
        which the focus of interest is on deriving design flood estimates of
        specified annual exceedance probability (AEP) rather than estimates of
        flood magnitude. This approach is also generally recommended for Very
        Rare to Extreme flood events. However, as the PMF event cannot be

      Rare to Extreme design floods.</para>

      <para>The procedures are generally based on the assumption that final
      design estimates should incorporate the best and most relevant
      information available. As emphasised in <xref linkend="book1"/> the use
      of new procedures and design information is encouraged, especially where
      these can be shown to be more appropriate than the guidance provided
      here.</para>

        <title>Flood Frequency Analyses</title>

        <para>The procedures recommended in <xref linkend="book3"/> are
        directly relevant to the estimation of Rare floods, and with the
        incorporation of regional information at-site flood frequency analysis
        can also be used to estimate Very Rare floods. Special consideration
        is provided here on the benefits of incorporating paleo-hydrological
        information, as this type of information has the potential to
        considerably extend the credible limit of extrapolation.</para>

        <title>Rainfall-Based Procedures</title>

        <para>The procedures provided in <xref linkend="book5"/> provide
        general guidance on the use of rainfall-based simulation methods. For
        risk-based design it is necessary to transform design rainfalls into
        floods in a fashion that minimises bias in the resulting exceedance
        probabilities; that is, we wish to ensure that the 1 in Y AEP design
        rainfalls are converted to the corresponding 1 in Y AEP floods. For
        those inputs and model parameters with a small impact on flood
        discharge it is usually sufficient to adopt a single representative
        value from the central range of observations; often either the mean or
        median is adopted. However, the most appropriate value depends on the
        degree of non-linearity in the transformation between rainfall and
        runoff and in the cumulative probability distribution. If one or both
        of these forms of non-linearity is great, it is desirable to adopt a
        joint probability approach in which the inputs and model parameters
        are characterised by their probability distributions rather than by a
        single value. This is particularly so for those inputs and model
        parameters with a large impact on flood magnitude.</para>

        <para>The adoption of a simplified probability-neutral approach is
        accepted practice for Frequent to Rare floods, where it is usually
        possible to derive independent estimates of the design floods to check
        that no bias has been introduced into the transformation between
        rainfall and runoff. Where such independent information is available,
        simple event based approaches, ie those involving the deterministic
        application of models based on linear and non-linear routing with
        representative values of inputs and model parameters, should be
        adequate for many practical purposes. However, it becomes increasingly
        difficult to obtain independent estimates of floods in the Very Rare
        to Extreme range, and thus there is an increased need to explicitly
        consider the joint probabilities involved. This is particularly so
        when considering the impacts of changing factors (such as revised
        operating conditions on reservoir levels) whose variability may be
        characterised with reasonable confidence but whose influences may not
        be reflected in the observed record. Ensemble event approaches have
        the potential to mitigate this bias, but these are only likely to be
        defensible for those problems (linearly) influenced by a single
        dominant factor in addition to rainfall. Monte Carlo simulation
        methods provide a more flexible and rigorous means of resolving these
        difficulties, but the defensibility of these estimates rests upon the
        representativeness of the inputs and the correct treatment of
        correlations which may be present.</para>

      <title>Procedures for Different Categories of Design Floods</title>

      <para>The procedures for deriving design estimates for flood classes of
      most relevance to extreme floods can be summarised in the following
      three main categories depending on the probability of the flood to be
      estimated:</para>

      <para>(i) <emphasis role="italic">Floods with AEPs approaching 1 in 100
      (Rare floods):</emphasis></para>

      <para>Estimates should be based on a combination of approaches that
      consider (where possible) at-site flood frequency analyses (<xref
      linkend="b2_ch2"/>), regional flood methods (<xref linkend="b2_ch3"/>),
      and rainfall-based event modelling (<xref linkend="b3_ch3_s_ynzmg"/>).
      The comparison of results obtained using different methods yields
      insights about errors or assumptions that might otherwise be missed, and
      the process of reconciling the different assessments provides valuable
      information that aids adoption of a final “best estimate”. As discussed
      in <xref linkend="b1_ch3"/>, the adoption of a single best estimate is
      ideally achieved by weighting estimates obtained from different methods
      by their uncertainty, or through the process of reconciliation in which
      selected factors are varied within their expected range to achieve the
      desired level of consistency.</para>

      <para>While there is scope for considering the use of continuous
      simulation approaches, their use for estimation of Vary Rare to Extreme
      events should only be considered for systems which are strongly
      dependent on flood volume in a manner not easily handled by event-based
      procedures; this might be the case for the design of tailings dams with
      small catchment areas, or cascade systems of storages involving complex
      interaction of joint probabilities. The advantages and limitations of
      continuous simulation approaches are broadly discussed in <xref
      linkend="b1_ch3"/>, but in the context of the estimation of extreme
      floods, it is worth noting that their use will require careful
      generation of stochastic rainfall inputs that are consistent with design
      rainfall information provided in <xref linkend="book2"/>. If the
      exceedance probabilities of interest lie in the Very Rare to Extreme
      event range then there is little point using a different approach for
      estimation of Rare floods.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="italic">(ii) Floods with AEPs beyond 1 in 100 AEP
      to the credible limit of extrapolation (Very Rare
      floods):</emphasis></para>

      <para>Estimates should be primarily based on rainfall-based simulation
      methods, with rainfalls derived using methods described in <xref
      linkend="b8_s_vgrwa"/>, or else on flood frequency estimates derived
      using historical and paleo flood information (<xref
      linkend="b8_s_e0h7b"/>). Such estimates necessarily involve significant
      extrapolation, and their defensibility will partly depend on the ease
      with which different estimates of Rare floods can be reconciled.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="italic">(iii) Floods with AEPs beyond the credible
      limit of extrapolation (Extreme floods, including the PMP
      Flood):</emphasis></para>

      <para>These flood estimates may be required for direct use in design
      situations of high risk, either in terms of risk to human life or
      economic losses, or where social or political considerations require a
      very high level of safety. Estimates should be based on the use of a
      flood event model with design rainfalls obtained by interpolation
      between the credible limit of extrapolated rainfalls and the PMP. To
      avoid confusion with the Probable Maximum Flood (see iv below), the
      flood derived from the PMP using probability-neutral assumptions is here
      termed the “PMP Flood”.</para>

      <para>An additional category of procedures differs from the above in its
      design objective:</para>

      <para><emphasis role="italic">(iv) Probable Maximum Flood (the limiting
      value of flood that could reasonably be expected to
      occur):</emphasis></para>

      <para>This may be required for comparison with estimates derived from
      previous studies or for some other design objective that usually
      requires a notional upper limiting value of flood without an associated
      AEP. In practice, the magnitude of the PMF will generally be greater
      than the magnitude of the flood derived from the PMP using
      probability-neutral assumptions (the PMP Flood).</para>

      <para>A brief summary of the recommended procedures and references to the relevant sections
        are presented in <xref linkend="b8_t_bkw7k"/> and <xref linkend="b8_t_vxhjn"/>. It should be
        recognised that these tables represent a summary of procedures that are described in detail

      <title>Relevance of Procedures to Specific Applications</title>

      <para>The procedures outlined in this Book are intended to cover the
      broad spectrum of applications listed in <xref linkend="b8_s_h5bgs"/>
      and the flood classes described in <xref linkend="b8_s_ji1cq"/>.
      However, when deriving flood estimates for a specific application, the
      practitioner’s interest may be focused on a more limited range of
      procedures. This section provides some guidance on the applicability of
      different parts of the guidelines to specific investigation or design
      tasks.</para>

      <para><xref linkend="b8_f_77nq1"/> gives a qualitative indication of the
      range of flood magnitudes and the relative degree of reliability
      required for different applications. An extension of the flood range of
      interest is associated with a greater degree of extrapolation and thus
      larger uncertainty (lower reliability). The level of expertise and
      effort required for deriving design floods increases with increasing
      level of reliability required.</para>

      <figure xml:id="b8_f_77nq1">
        <title>Qualitative indication of the range of flood magnitudes and the
        relative degree of reliability required for different

      </figure>

      <para>As shown in <xref linkend="b8_f_77nq1"/>, the qualitative
      indication of the range of flood magnitudes and associated relative
      degree of reliability can be divided into four groups of applications.
      For the first three groups of applications, approximate or simplified
      flood estimation procedures may be applicable; however, the practitioner
      has to apply his/her own judgement in deciding on the degree of detail
      and accuracy required for a specific application. The fourth group of
      applications demands the most accurate estimates and hence the greatest
      level of effort.</para>

      <para>(i) <emphasis role="italic">Planning and feasibility studies,
      initial screening of options, preliminary designs:</emphasis></para>

      <para>For these types of applications, where decisions based on the
      flood estimates are only moderately sensitive to estimation
      uncertainties, approximate design flood estimates can be derived by
      preliminary methods (see <xref linkend="b8_s_laqj1"/>).</para>

      <para>(ii) <emphasis role="italic">Performance checks or preliminary
      designs of structures:</emphasis></para>

      <para>Many design codes require safety checks for conditions exceeding
      the design objective. Approximate estimates of floods with AEPs from 1
      in 100 to an absolute limit of 1 in 2000 can be obtained by use of
      design rainfalls (<xref linkend="b2_ch3"/>) in combination with a flood
      event model configured using regional estimates of losses and routing
      parameters. The rainfall frequency curve may be extended to the AEP of
      the PMP by deriving site-specific estimates of the PMP. Flood estimates
      based on use of regional parameters without calibration or additional
      confirmatory estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty, and
      correspondingly greater responsibility then rests with the designer to
      ensure that the estimates are consistent with any relevant flood
      estimates for the region.</para>

      <para>(iii) <emphasis role="italic">Design of floodplain management or
      flood protection schemes based on risk management
      principles:</emphasis></para>

      <para>While risk-based design requires the assessment of the
      contribution of Rare to Extreme floods to the total expected flood
      damage figure, the low probability of floods in this range means that
      the contribution from this range of floods to the total expected flood
      damage is relatively low in most situations. A lower degree of
      reliability of flood estimates in the Rare to Extreme range is therefore
      acceptable for these applications.</para>

      <para>(iv)<emphasis role="italic"> Final design of major works and
      assessment of the adequacy of existing infrastructure, where failure
      would result in serious consequences or possible of
      life:</emphasis></para>

      <para>For this category of applications, efforts should be made to
      reduce uncertainties in design flood estimates to the minimum possible.
      The further the AEP range of interest extends beyond the Rare floods,
      the more important it is for the practitioner to consider in detail the
      guidelines in <xref linkend="b8_ch4"/> and <xref linkend="b8_ch5"/> on
      extrapolation of hydrograph model characteristics. For all applications
      where the range of interest extends to extreme floods, and where large
      uncertainty in flood estimates would impact significantly on design
      decisions, detailed flood studies are justified.</para>

        <title>Overview of Requirements and Sources of Design Rainfall Information</title>

        <para>In general, estimates of Very Rare to Extreme floods are derived
        using <emphasis role="italic">rainfall-based flood estimation
        methods</emphasis> (possible exceptions to this are discussed in <xref
        linkend="b8_s_dkdq3"/>). Information is required on the average depth
        of rainfall over the catchment for a range of rainfall event
        durations, its distribution in space (spatial pattern) and its
        distribution in time during the event (temporal pattern). Design
        floods are generally calculated separately for each duration,
        including routing through any reservoirs or other storages, to
        determine the critical rainfall durations that produce the maxima for
        the flood characteristics of interest (peak inflow/outflow, flood
        volume or possibly duration of flooding). Short duration design
        rainfalls may be required even on large catchments to check that their
        occurrence on only part of the catchment area does not produce a
        critical flood, and to check that the magnitudes of the calculated
        floods vary in a regular manner as the duration of the rainfall
        increases.</para>

        <para><xref linkend="b2_ch3"/> provides details of <emphasis
        role="italic">design rainfall depths at a grid of points</emphasis>
        over the whole of Australia for the range of AEPs and rainfall event
        durations of interest for the estimation of Very Rare to Extreme
        floods. Except for the PMP, these design rainfall depths are point
        rainfalls at the grid point location; they need to be converted to
        <emphasis role="italic">average catchment rainfalls</emphasis> by
        application of the <emphasis role="italic">areal reduction factors
        (ARFs)</emphasis> provided in <xref linkend="b2_ch4"/>.</para>

        <para>General guidance on <emphasis role="italic">design spatial
        rainfall patterns</emphasis> is provided in <xref linkend="b2_ch4"/>.
        This guidance generally applies to design spatial patterns for the
        estimation of Very Rare to Extreme floods, with some more specific
        guidance provided in <xref linkend="b8_s_sborg"/> of this book. The
        limited information available on spatial patterns of extreme storm
        events generally precludes the application of an ensemble of spatial
        patterns; spatial patterns can be sampled in an ensemble fashion in
        stochastic simulation frameworks, but generally a single
        representative pattern derived from design rainfall fields (or
        observed storms) in a larger region is sufficient for most design
        purposes.</para>

        <para>The guidance provided in <xref linkend="b2_ch5"/> for the
        selection of <emphasis role="italic">design temporal rainfall
        patterns</emphasis> also generally applies to the range of Very Rare
        to Extreme floods, with some more specific guidance provided in <xref
        linkend="b8_s_4n0lw"/> of this book. Given the sensitivity of flood
        estimates to the high degree of natural variability in the temporal
        patterns of actual storms, it is recommended that an ensemble of
        temporal patterns rather than a single ‘representative’ temporal
        pattern is applied.</para>

        <title>Uncertainty in Design Rainfall Estimates</title>

        <para>There is only limited detailed information on the uncertainty
        associated with the rainfall estimates provided in <xref
        linkend="b2_ch3"/>. It should be recognised that the magnitude of the
        uncertainty in design rainfall estimates increases with decreasing AEP
        (<?oxy_custom_start type="oxy_content_highlight" color="255,255,0"?>see
        <emphasis role="bold">Error! Reference source not
        found.</emphasis><?oxy_custom_end ?>), as model uncertainty plays an
        increasingly important part in the estimation of extreme events,
        including the PMP. Some information is available on the more recent
        estimates of Very Rare to Extreme rainfalls (e.g. McConachy et al.,
        1997; Nandakumar et al., 1997), and this may be used to provide some
        indication of the uncertainties involved in other design rainfall
        estimates. The uncertainty of design rainfall estimates reflects the
        level of information available, with significantly increased
        uncertainty in areas of sparse rain gauge coverage, such as
        mountainous areas.</para>

    <section xml:id="b8_s_8tx6d">
      <title>Estimation of Very Rare Design Rainfalls</title>

      <para>Design rainfall depths for Very Rare events are derived by
      regional estimation methods, such as the regional L-Moment method
      described in <xref linkend="b2_ch3_s7_0"/>. These methods pool data from
      large rainfall events in a region that satisfies basic homogeneity
      criteria. By using a ‘space for time trade-off’, these methods allow
      estimation of rarer events than would be possible by using data from an
      individual site only.</para>

      <para>The AEP range covered by regional estimates, referred to as the
      ‘credible range of extrapolation’, depends on the number of stations in
      a region and the length and quality of their records. For the relatively
      well gauged parts of Australia this range has been taken as extending to
      an AEP of 1 in 2000.</para>

      <para>Practitioners should recognise that making available design
      rainfall estimates for a dense grid covering the whole of Australia has
      been achieved at the cost of potentially reduced accuracy at locations
      for which long and reliable rainfall records are available. However, the
      results of frequency analysis of local records should only be used to
      fine-tune regional design rainfall estimates if there is strong evidence
      confirmed by peer review. In such a situation the shape of the rainfall
      frequency curve in the range of Very Rare events should closely follow
      the shape indicated by the regional estimate.</para>

      <title>Estimation of the PMP Depth</title>

      <para>The theoretical definition of the Probable Maximum Precipitation
      (PMP) is “the greatest depth of precipitation for a given duration that
      is physically possible over a given size storm area at a particular
      geographical location at a certain time of year” (World Meteorological
      Organisation, 1986a). Estimates are derived using generalised methods
      that are based on the analysis of data over a wide region, as described
      in <xref linkend="b2_ch3_s7_0"/>.</para>

      <para>Estimates of PMP rainfall data have been developed by the Bureau
      of Meteorology. There are three generalised methods appropriate for
      different locations and durations: (i) the Generalised Short Duration
      Method (GSDM) is applicable for durations up to six hours and areas up
      to 1000 km2 (Bureau of Meteorology, 2003a), (ii) the Generalised
      Tropical Storm Method (GTSMR) is used to estimate PMPs for durations up
      to 120 hours and areas up to 150 000 km2 in the region of Australia
      where tropical storms are the source of the greatest depths of rainfall
      (Bureau of Meteorology, 2003b), and (iii) the Generalised Southeast
      Australia Method (GSAM) is used for durations up to 96 hours and areas
      up to 100 000 km2 for the region of Australia where tropical storms are
      not the source of the greatest depths of rainfall (Bureau of
      Meteorology, 2006). The zones of application for the GTSM and GSAM
      methods are shown in <xref linkend="b8_f_uat9x"/>. It For the west coast
      of Tasmania, data constraints and the size of region have prevented the
      development of a generalised method, and thus site-specific advice
      should be sought from the Bureau of Meteorology. It should be noted that
      the PMP estimates provided by the Bureau of Meteorology are for
      <emphasis role="italic">design rainfall bursts rather than complete
      storm events</emphasis>, though these can be adjusted to include likely
      pre-burst rainfalls using information provided by Minty and Meighen
      (1999) and <xref linkend="b2_ch5"/>.</para>

      <para>All PMP estimates are based on a set of simplifying assumptions
      applied when extrapolating from the hydrometeorological conditions of
      observed large events to “maximised conditions”. They thus represent
      <emphasis role="italic">operational estimates of the PMP</emphasis> and
      should not be interpreted as being equivalent to a theoretical upper

      <title>Assigning an AEP to the PMP</title>

      <section xml:id="b8_s_n9mfu">
        <title>Background</title>

        <para>Assigning an AEP to the PMP is consistent with the concept of
        operational PMP estimates (as described above and in <xref
        linkend="b2_ch3_s7_0"/>), which should not be regarded as theoretical
        upper limits of rainfall, as they may conceivably be exceeded.</para>

        <para>The method proposed to assign an AEP to the PMP is based on the
        review by Laurenson and Kuczera (1999) of the procedures recommended
        in the 1987 edition of ARR and subsequent work done both in Australia
        and overseas. More recent research into regional estimates for the
        inland zone of south-east Australia (Nathan et al, 2015) provides some
        evidence to suggest that the Laurenson-Kuczera recommendations might
        be slightly conservative, though they concluded that there is
        insufficient justification to consider changing either the best
        estimate or the inferred width of the confidence intervals.</para>

        <para>Overall it is considered that recommendations provided below
        represent a reasonable basis for design, and that the associated
        confidence intervals do reflect the true uncertainty involved. It
        should be recognised that this is an area of ongoing research and
        users should take advantage of revised guidance where shown to be more
        appropriate by independent peer review.</para>
      </section>

      <section xml:id="b8_s_0ndc5">
        <title>Regional Recommendations</title>

        <para>The AEP of PMP estimates are considered to vary solely as a
        function of catchment area, and are similar to the recommendations of
        Kennedy and Hart (1984). These recommendations had been adopted as the
        basis of the guidance provided in the 1987 edition of ARR, and are
        consistent with the more recent estimates of Pearse and Laurenson
        (1997) and Nathan et al. (1999, 2015). The relationship recommended by
        Laurenson and Kuczera (1999) is shown graphically in <xref
        linkend="b8_f_uat9x"/>. It should be noted that these AEP estimates
        indicate the probability of a PMP event in any part of the year
        (annual PMP). The question of the AEP of a PMP event occurring in a
        specific season (seasonal PMP) is addressed in <xref
        linkend="b8_s_9piio"/>.</para>

        <para>It should be recognised that there is considerable uncertainty
        surrounding these recommendations as they are for events beyond the
        realm of experience and are based on a limited body of information.
        The estimates should be interpreted as follows:</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>the recommended AEP values plus or minus one order of

            about 75% subjective probability that the true AEP lies within
            these limits; and,</para>

          </table>In order to incorporate this uncertainty into a risk
        analysis, Laurenson and Kuczera (1999) recommend the construction of a
        probability mass function that provides a 75% chance that the true AEP
        lies within one-order-of-magnitude of the recommended AEP, and a 100%
        chance that the true AEP lies within two-orders-of-magnitude of the
        recommended AEP. <xref linkend="b8_t_vskyx"/> presents an example of a
        probability mass function which meets these requirements. For example
        if the recommended AEP were 1 in 10<superscript>6</superscript>, then
        there is an 11.0% chance that the true AEP lies between 1 in
        10<superscript>6</superscript> and 1 in
        10<superscript>5.75</superscript>, and there is a 42.4% chance that it
        lies between 1 in 10<superscript>5.5</superscript> and 1 in
        10<superscript>6.5</superscript>; the first example corresponds simply
        to a single probability interval adjacent to the mid-point of 0.00 in
        <xref linkend="b8_t_vskyx"/>, and the second example corresponds to
        the central four probability intervals. Although the probabilities are
        subjective, they do reflect the considerable uncertainty in the AEP
        estimates. The uncertainty can be directly incorporated into a risk
        analysis by performing an assessment for each of the AEPs in <xref
        linkend="b8_t_vskyx"/> and weighting the results using the associated
        subjective probability.</para>

        <title>Site-Specific Estimation</title>

        <para>Laurenson and Kuczera (1999) recommendations included a review
        of appropriate approaches, and they concluded that the most promising
        avenues of research were based on total probability approaches
        developed and applied by National Research Council (1988), Fontaine
        and Potter (1989) and Wilson and Foufoula-Georgiou (1990). Another
        promising method was demonstrated by Klemes (1993) who developed a
        combinatorial approach that considered the joint distributions of the
        independent components that combined to produce PMP, and this was
        applied to the coastal GSAM methodology by Pearse and Laurenson
        (1997).</para>

        <para>More recently (Nathan et al, 2015) described the development and
        application of two largely independent methods for deriving
        site-specific estimates of the AEP of PMP. One method uses the total
        probability theorem to combine the probabilities of extreme storms
        occurring in the transposition region with the likelihood that they
        were positioned in a manner that would equal or exceed the estimated
        target depth on the catchment for the specified duration. The other
        method involved the development of a stochastic regression model to
        estimate catchment rainfalls from point rainfalls at the key sites,
        and is based on an approach developed and applied by Schaefer over a
        number of years (eg MGS Engineering and Applied Climate Services,
        2014).</para>

        <para>These studies are mentioned to make the point that methods are
        available to derive site-specific estimates that are potentially more
        defensible than the regional recommendations described in the
        preceding section. While there remain a number of research questions
        which, if resolved, may increase confidence in such estimates, the
        undertaking of site-specific studies does merit practical
        consideration. Until the required methodology is more mature such
        studies would need to be undertaken by specialists with peer review.
        It is expected that this option is of most relevance to a minority of
        cases which involve the design of infrastructure on large catchments
        (&gt; 1000 km2) with high potential consequences of failure.</para>

        <title>General</title>

        <para>The foregoing sections provide recommendations on deriving
        catchment rainfall estimates for Very Rare events to the credible
        limit of extrapolation and for the PMP. In order to derive a complete
        areal rainfall frequency curve it is necessary to interpolate between
        these two limits. The interpolation is necessarily pragmatic as it
        attempts to link estimates based on conceptually different methods and
        different data sets. As there are no independently estimated design
        rainfalls for this range of AEPs, any specific interpolation procedure
        cannot be supported by direct evidence but it must be able to produce
        plausible and consistent estimates. The practical implication of this
        is that design rainfall estimates for Extreme events have a greater
        level of uncertainty than the events within the credible limit of
        extrapolation.</para>

        <para>Estimates of rainfalls for Extreme events beyond the credible
        limit of extrapolation are predicated on the following two design
        rainfall characteristics, namely:</para>

        <para>(i) the magnitude and AEP of the PMP; and,</para>

        <para>(ii) the rainfall depth and slope of the rainfall frequency
        curve at the credible limit of extrapolation.</para>

        <para>As discussed above, estimates of the AEP of the PMP are subject
        to a high degree of uncertainty and are based on the interpretation of
        the PMP values as operational estimates that can be exceeded, rather
        than upper limiting values of rainfall. This interpretation of the PMP
        implies that the frequency curve should not be asymptotic to the
        horizontal at the estimated PMP, but rather extend through the PMP at
        a slope consistent with the shape of the lower sections of the
        frequency curve.</para>

        <title>Interpolation Procedure</title>

        <section xml:id="b8_s_yx63s">
          <title>Basis of procedure</title>

          <para>Siriwardena and Weinmann (1998) developed a procedure suited
          to the interpolation between regional estimates of Very Rare
          rainfalls and the PMP. The procedure was developed and tested on
          Victorian data using design information from the CRC-FORGE
          procedure. While it is possible that other procedures may be
          developed for other regions, the procedure developed by Siriwardena
          and Weinmann is described here as it is considered to have generic
          applicability.</para>

          <para>The procedure is applicable to ‘gaps’ of different ranges
          corresponding to differences in both the AEP of the credible limit
          of extrapolation and to the assigned AEP of the PMP. The procedure
          involves the fitting of a 2-parameter parabolic function in log-log
          space to ensure a smooth, well-behaved function when design
          rainfalls are plotted against AEP on logarithmic scales. The
          following boundary conditions are adopted:</para>

          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>at the starting point of interpolation, the slope of the
              interpolated curve matches the slope defined by design estimates
              from the upper segment of the frequency curve bounded at the
              upper end by the credible limit of extrapolation; and,</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>the slope of the interpolated curve through the PMP
              estimate is not constrained to the horizontal but is determined
              by the shape of the frequency curve at AEPs more frequent than
              that assigned to the PMP.</para>
            </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>

          <para>It needs to be emphasised that the interpolation is entirely
          determined by estimates of the conditions at the two end points; no
          additional information is introduced in fitting the curve. Details
          on the derivation of the procedure can be found in Siriwardena and
          Weinmann (1998).</para>

          . The slope of the frequency curve at the commencement of the

          <para>For Victoria, Siriwardena and Weinmann recommend that the
          slope of the frequency curve at the commencement of the
          interpolation should be defined by the 1 in 1000 AEP and 1 in 2000
          AEP events, i.e. Y<subscript>1</subscript> = 1000 and
          Y<subscript>2</subscript> = 2000. Thus the start point of
          interpolation is the credible limit of extrapolation obtained using
          the CRC-FORGE method (Weinmann et al., 1999).</para>

          <para>The above concepts are schematically illustrated in <xref
          linkend="b8_f_59irn"/>. Siriwardena and Weinmann (1998) have tested
          the above interpolation procedure on 25 catchments ranging in size
          from 25 to 15000 km<superscript>2</superscript> with diverse
          characteristics. The resultant frequency curves were shown to be
          plausible and well behaved for all test catchments. However, it is
          worth noting that Hill et al (2000) reported that the above
          interpolation approach did not yield plausible results for
          GSAM-derived storms for 13 small catchments in South Australia. They
          observed that inconsistences in the relationship between rainfall
          depth and catchment size for short- and long-duration events
          resulted in physically infeasible frequency curves (ie values of
          S<subscript>gc</subscript>/S<subscript>gap</subscript> exceeded
          2.0). This problem was largely obviated by undertaking the above
          interpolation procedure in the log-Normal domain (ie using the
          standard normal variate of the exceedance probabilities rather than
          the log of the inverse of AEP); in a few cases it was also necessary
          to slightly increase the estimate of the AEP of the PMP, but the
          degree of change was well less than the notional uncertainty
          involved. Thus, while the recommended interpolation procedure has
          been found to generally yield plausible results, it may be necessary
          to make pragmatic adjustments to the method where dictated by
          circumstances.</para>

        <para>Sites with daily rainfall records provide a considerably denser
        spatial coverage and longer period of record than is available from
        the pluviograph network. The majority of effort to date has been
        focussed on the derivation of Very Rare design rainfalls for burst
        durations of 24 hours and longer (as provided in <xref
        linkend="book2"/>), and by comparison the availability of design
        information for shorter duration rainfalls is rather limited.</para>

        <para>At present, the most defensible estimates of Very Rare sub-daily
        rainfalls are provided by Jordan et al (2005). These estimates are
        based on the analysis of data from ten pluviograph sites around
        Australia. Melbourne had the longest period of record (130 years), but
        another five stations (Darwin, Sydney, Hobart, Adelaide, and Perth)
        had over 80 years of record each. The frequency analysis was
        undertaken using the simple “station year” method as the data
        satisfied the required assumptions of independence and homogeneity
        (the storms were largely derived from thunderstorm or deeply
        convective events). For the ten stations analysed, this pooled data
        set represents a sequence of around 800 station years. Non-dimensional
        frequency curves were derived for eight durations varying between 0.5
        and 12 hours. The mean growth curve obtained from these distributions
        fell well within the 90% confidence limits, and the tabulated values
        are shown in <xref linkend="b8_t_hk25s"/>.</para>

        <para>Pending the outcome of more comprehensive analyses, it is
        recommended that the growth curve factors as listed in <xref
        linkend="b8_t_hk25s"/> be used for design purposes. Rainfall depths
        for durations between 0.5 and 12 hours can be obtained by simply
        multiplying the relevant 1 in 100 AEP design rainfall by the frequency
        factors shown in <xref linkend="b8_t_hk25s"/>. It should be noted that
        these factors represent the characteristics of events that are
        associated with thunderstorm, or deeply convective, storm activity and
        are derived from analyses that are largely independent of the data and
        procedures described in <xref linkend="b2_ch3"/>. Accordingly, in some

        growth factors between the values shown in <xref

        and longer). If this is the case then it may be necessary to smooth

        <para>For dams with very large storage volumes relative to the volumes
        of inflow floods (or dams with little or no spillway provision), or
        for some very large catchments, it is possible that the critical
        duration of interest may be longer than available from the generalised
        design rainfall information. The longest available storm duration
        using <xref linkend="book2"/> procedures is 168 hours. This duration
        generally relates to the meteorological limits associated with single
        storm events, and thus longer duration design events involve the
        consideration of storm sequences.</para>

        <para>The approach to solving design problems involving long critical
        durations is in essence a joint probability problem. In special

        associated with reservoir outflow floods, the issue of storm sequences

          by a rainfall event in the 15 days prior to the storm. Based on
          their magnitude, these antecedent rainfall events appear to comprise
          two different populations: most (32% of all large storms) had
          accumulated rainfall totals of less than 30% of the subsequent large
          storm, but a small proportion (8% of all large storms) had

        <para>The derivation of the design rainfall data presented in <xref

        assumption that rainfall is independent of the season in which it
        occurs, or at least that its seasonal variation does not have a
        significant influence on the design outcome. However, there are
        situations where the seasonal variation of rainfall characteristics is
        significant and may need to be taken into account in design flood
        estimation. As an example, severe thunderstorms may occur
        predominantly during the summer season. Where other design factors
        (such as initial loss or initial reservoir level) are also
        characterised by significant seasonal variation, it may be necessary
        to combine seasonal design rainfalls with the corresponding seasonal
        values of these other design factors, rather than with their average
        annual values. For this purpose, a season is defined as a period of
        one to several months during which the rainfall conditions (and other
        design factors) can be assumed to be the same.</para>

        <para><xref linkend="b8_s_9piio"/> describes typical design situations where seasonal
          estimates of design rainfalls for Very Rare to Extreme events may be required. While it
          would appear sensible in these design situations to deal explicitly with seasonal effects,
          there are a number of practical and theoretical issues that are not easily resolved. Some

          However, this approach can provide inconsistent seasonal estimates

          theoretically this could be overcome by developing a fitting
          procedure that jointly fits all the seasonal distributions. In

          <para>The first approach is based on the assumption that factors
          other than dew point (and factors deriving from that) affecting the
          value of PMP do not significantly vary with season. This is
          consistent with the Bureau of Meteorology’s assumption that each
          season has its own PMP; in other words, the magnitudeof the seasonal
          PMP is different for different months of the year. It also follows
          that the probability of experiencing a PMP event of different
          magnitude in any month of the year is equal.</para>

          <para>This interpretation means that the exceedance probability of a
          PMP event occurring <emphasis role="italic">in a specific
          season</emphasis> of the year is proportional to the fraction of the
          year occupied by that season, but it does not yield directly an
          estimate of the exceedance probability of a seasonal PMP. The
          additional constraint to be considered follows from an argument
          based on extreme value theory, namely that the sum of the exceedance
          probabilities of events of <emphasis role="italic">the same
          magnitude </emphasis>for the different seasons should add to the AEP
          of the annual rainfall event of that magnitude.</para>

          <para>In practice, an iterative approach needs to be adopted, using
          the product of the AEP of the annual PMP and the fraction of the
          year occupied by the season as an initial (lower bound) estimate of
          the exceedance probability of the seasonal PMP estimates. These
          initial estimates are shown as hollow circles in <xref
          linkend="b8_f_06jbo"/>. A segment of the complete design rainfall
          frequency curve for each season then needs to be drawn between the
          rainfall depths of the largest and smallest seasonal PMP estimates
          (indicated by broken lines in <xref linkend="b8_f_06jbo"/>). Over
          the upper range of the seasonal rainfall magnitudes, the curve
          segments can be assumed to be parallel to the annual frequency
          curve. The addition of the AEPs corresponding to the annual PMP
          estimated from each seasonal rainfall curve will generally yield an
          AEP less than the AEP assigned to the annual PMP. The ratio of these
          two AEP estimates defines the correction factor (&gt; 1.0) that
          needs to be applied to each of the initially estimated AEPs of the
          seasonal PMP. This correction is indicated by arrows in <xref

          <para>Unless specific regional estimates are available, the seasonal
          fractions corresponding to design rainfalls at the credible limit of
          extrapolation may be obtained by an interpolation procedure similar
          to that used for losses (e.g. linear interpolation on a log-log
          frequency plot – <xref linkend="b8_e_4dyk0"/>). The lower and upper
          end points used in the interpolation are defined, respectively, by
          the seasonal fractions derived for the 1 in 100 AEP and PMP design
          rainfalls. Once the seasonal fractions have been obtained by
          interpolation, seasonal design rainfalls for Very Rare events are
          derived by multiplying the fractions by the (annual) design rainfall
          values at the credible limit of extrapolation.</para>

          design rainfalls for the corresponding season, the seasonal PMP
          estimates should be assigned an AEP equal to the product of the AEP
          of the annual PMP (from <xref linkend="b8_f_2386f"/>) and the
          fraction of the year occupied by the season. These AEPs need to be

          illustrated in <xref linkend="b8_f_sw31s"/>). It is important to
          recognise that the uncertainty associated with the currently

        the catchment. This sensitivity can best be allowed for by applying an

          <para>It should be noted that ensemble sets of temporal patterns are
          available for the GSAM and GTSM-R methods, and these should be used
          as required for the Ensemble Event and Monte Carlo Event approaches.
          For Very Rare events it may be appropriate to use of a mix of
          selected at-site and generalised PMP patterns in an ensemble to
          provide a smooth transition over the full probability domain of
          interest. At present, the best source of ensemble temporal patterns
          for use with short duration very Rare to Extreme events are those
          derived by Jordan et al. (2005); these patterns were derived
          specifically from storms associated with thunderstorm or deeply
          convective events.</para>

          <para>An issue requiring specific mention is the absence of temporal
          patterns in southeastern Australia for use with storm durations
          between the upper limit of GSDM (3 or 6 hours) and the lower limit
          of the GSAM method (generally 24 hours). A pragmatic solution to
          this problem is to apply both sets of temporal patterns and to adopt
          a weighted average peak flow, where the weighting is based on storm
          duration. The weighted average peak flow is then used to scale the
          hydrograph obtained using the most relevant generalised method;
          weighting all the ordinates of the hydrograph is not recommended as
          the resulting hydrograph may exhibit a lower peak than either of the
          individual hydrographs.</para>

          <para>In the transition zone between the GTSM-R and GSAM regions,
          temporal patterns from both the GSAM and GTSM-R methods should be
          applied separately (in conjunction with the corresponding spatial
          patterns), and the largest flood adopted.</para>

          <title>Dealing with inconsistencies and smoothing of results</title>

          <para>In practice, the simplistic use of single design temporal
          patterns for different durations and AEPs can yield flood estimates
          that do not vary in a consistent manner. In extreme cases, this can
          result in design flood magnitudes that decrease with decreasing AEP.
          More typically, the patterns may result in critical storm durations
          that vary inconsistently with AEP; such a variation will impact upon
          the volume of design hydrographs which, when routed through a
          reservoir, may produce inconsistent results. The judicious use of
          simulation results using ensembles of temporal patters will largely
          avoid such inconsistencies. Problems are more likely to occur with
          the transition between temporal patterns for more frequent events
          and those derived for PMP events. If problems arise consideration
          should be given to filtering out (or excluding) embedded bursts of
          lower AEP by re-distributing rainfalls of high intensity to other
          time increments proportionally to their magnitude (eg Herron et al,
          2011). Where significant inconsistencies remain, practitioners will
          need to apply judicious smoothing of results for different durations
          and AEPs.<table frame="void" xml:id="b8_t_kjsmh">

        <title>Basis of Adopted Patterns</title>

        <para>Design spatial rainfall patterns are also required to fully
        define design rainfall events, and general guidance on this is
        provided in Chapter 4 Book 4. The source of spatial patterns as a
        function of burst duration and AEP is broadly similar to that adopted
        for temporal patterns (except for the Very Rare rainfall category),
        and is summarised in <xref linkend="b8_t_r78ov"/>. It is seen that
        there are four main sources of design information: patterns based on
        the spatial distribution of design rainfalls for Very Rare events,
        spatial patterns for use in southeastern Australia (Minty et al.,
        1996), GSDM thunderstorm patterns (Bureau of Meteorology, 2003a), and
        tropical storm patterns (Bureau of Meteorology, 2003b). As with
        temporal patterns, the last three sets of patterns were originally
        derived for application to PMP events, but in the absence of any more
        relevant information they are applied to the range of Very Rare to
        Extreme events.</para>

        <para>Except for catchments with marked rainfall gradients, the
        spatial distribution of rainfall generally has less influence on the
        shape and size of the resulting hydrograph than temporal patterns.
        Thunderstorm and tropical patterns can have an appreciable effect on
        flood magnitude, particularly if the catchment contains extensive
        drowned reaches resulting from reservoir inundation. For such
        catchments, small variations in the spatial distribution of design
        rainfall may have a marked impact on the magnitude of the flood peak.
        It is worth assessing the sensitivity of the catchment floods to
        variations in spatial patterns, and if this is not easily resolved
        then it would be necessary to include spatial patterns as an ensemble
        in Monte Carlo analyses.</para>

    <section xml:id="b8_s_gqxjb">
      <title>General Considerations</title>

      <para>A loss model is needed to partition the design rainfall input into
      rainfall excess (runoff) and loss. General guidance on loss modelling
      for the types of loss models used in common practice is provided in
      <xref linkend="b5_ch5"/>. The following considerations and guidelines
      focus specifically on aspects of loss estimation related to the
      estimation of Very Rare to Extreme floods. The guidance is applicable to
      simulations undertaken using both deterministic and stochastic
      frameworks.</para>

      <para>The specific recommendations in <xref linkend="b8_s_kprjg"/> apply
      to loss parameters for the Initial Loss – Continuing Loss (IL-CL)
      model<emphasis role="italic">,</emphasis> as a large body of relevant
      experience has been accumulated over many years. However, other loss
      models may be used if they can be shown to be more appropriate in the
      specific situation.</para>

      <section xml:id="b8_s_5cenz">
        <title>Importance of Design Losses – Very Rare to Extreme
        Events</title>

        <para>Like temporal patterns of storm rainfall, design losses are
        highly variable and can have an appreciable impact on both the peak
        and volume of the resulting flood. A given rainfall occurring on a dry
        watershed produces a significantly smaller flood than the same
        rainfall occurring on a wet watershed. For more frequent events, loss
        may be the most important factor. Joint probability approaches (e.g.
        Weinmann et al., 1998) are better able to deal with the high
        variability of design losses as, in contrast to the design event
        approach, they use a probability distribution of loss values, rather
        than a single ‘representative value’. (‘Representative’ means that the
        selected design loss values should ensure a ‘probability neutral’
        transformation of the design rainfall input of a given AEP into a
        design flood output of the same AEP.) However, the impact of the
        inter-event variability of losses and the relative importance of
        losses diminishes with decreasing AEP, and for Extreme events it is
        likely that losses are of lesser importance than temporal patterns.
        For the estimation of Very Rare to Extreme floods, the use of
        single-valued representative design losses may be adequate, though
        when simulating long duration events for volume-dependent problems it
        may be appropriate to adopt stochastic approaches as discussed in
        <xref linkend="b8_s_gncno"/>.</para>

        <para>For extreme rains and floods, a much greater proportion of a
        catchment may become saturated during the event than is the case for
        most floods in the observed range. Also, during extreme rainfalls,
        vegetation may be stripped from the catchment, thus resulting in an
        increase in the volume and speed of the overland flow component of
        runoff (Kemp and Daniell, 1997). Any evidence relevant to the changed
        behaviour of the catchment under extreme rainfall conditions should be

        <title>Losses Associated With Design Storms and Design Bursts</title>

        <para>When considering the adoption of design losses it is necessary
        to understand the distinction between <emphasis role="italic">design
        bursts</emphasis> of rainfall, and <emphasis role="italic">design
        storms</emphasis>. The difference between the two concepts and the
        implications of the two concepts for the estimation of design losses
        are explained in <xref linkend="b5_ch5_s_oj30q"/>. The selection of
        design loss values must take into consideration the manner in which
        the design information was derived, and whether the losses are to be
        applied to design storms or design bursts. More specifically, there is
        a significant difference between the initial loss values applicable to
        design storms and design rainfall bursts, and how these loss values
        can be expected to vary with event magnitude (see <xref
        linkend="b8_s_wzey8"/>).</para>

        <title>Variation of Loss Values with Event Magnitude</title>

        <para>Different loss models will behave differently when extrapolated
        to Extreme events, as they introduce differing degrees of
        non-linearity into the transfer between design rainfalls and the
        resulting hydrograph. Thus, even if different loss models are able to
        reproduce calibration events equally well, adoption of the same loss
        parameters for derivation of Extreme design floods may produce
        significantly different design flood hydrographs. For example, a
        specific set of loss parameters for the initial loss – continuing loss
        (IL-CL) and initial loss – proportional loss (IL-PL) models may yield
        similar flood peaks for the 1 in 100 AEP design event, but if the same
        parameters were retained to derive the 1 in
        10<superscript>6</superscript> AEP flood, the different loss models
        would produce markedly different design flood hydrographs. The impact
        of model structure on the extrapolation of loss parameters for
        application to Very Rare to Extreme events must thus be carefully
        considered.</para>

        <para>The discussion in <xref linkend="b5_ch5_s_oj30q"/> makes it
        clear that storm initial loss (IL<subscript>s</subscript>) and burst
        initial loss (IL<subscript>b</subscript>) are expected to show a
        different degree of variation with event magnitude. The two types of
        initial loss for rural catchments are therefore treated separately in
        (i) and (ii) below.</para>

        <para>The interpretation of <emphasis role="italic">proportional
        loss</emphasis> (PL) as the unsaturated proportion of the catchment
        implies that with larger storm events the unsaturated proportion of
        the catchment is reducing and thus the proportional loss also reduces.
        As it is difficult to extrapolate the rate of this reduction to
        Extreme events, the proportional loss model is generally considered
        less appropriate for estimating Very Rare to Extreme floods. On the
        other hand, the <emphasis role="italic">continuing loss
        rate</emphasis> (CL) is expected to approach a limiting value for
        saturated catchment conditions, and this limiting value is the
        appropriate design loss rate for all events for which the saturation
        threshold has been exceeded. More detailed discussion of the variation
        of CL with event magnitude for rural catchments is given in (iii)
        below.</para>

            <para>The available evidence to support the conceptual
            interpretation of loss variation includes the results obtained by
            Hill et al. (1996a); these indicated little or no variation of
            design losses with rainfall severity for events more frequent than
            1 in 100 AEP. For ILs, this finding implies little or no
            correlation between the magnitudes of pre-storm rainfall
            (producing the storm antecedent conditions) and storm event
            rainfall for events more frequent than 1 in 100 AEP.</para>

            <para>An analysis of the rainfall conditions prior to the largest
            storms on record in the GSAM region of south-eastern Australia
            (Minty and Meighen, 1999) indicated qualitatively no propensity
            for “greater than normal” rainfall in the 15 days immediately
            preceding these large storms. The analysis by Minty and Meighen
            shows that about 75% of the largest storms on record in
            south-eastern Australia were preceded by rainfall totals of less
            than 10% of the depth of the storm. Further, the analysis revealed
            that the average length of the dry period between pre-storm
            rainfall and the storms was about 8 days.</para>

            <para>The available evidence thus suggests that there is no need
            to vary ILs with event magnitudes up to the largest event on
            record. Further research is desirable to confirm the applicability
            of these findings of little or no variation of ILs with event
            magnitude to regions outside south-eastern Australia.</para>

            <para>For events of increasing duration and intensity of rainfall,
            an increasing proportion of the catchment is expected to become
            saturated, resulting in a reduced catchment average value of CL.
            However, the available evidence from Hill et al. (1996a) based on
            catchments located in Victoria and the ACT indicates no systematic
            differences in CL for observed events in the AEP range from 1 in 2
            to 1 in 100. This can be interpreted to mean that, except in
            catchments with highly pervious soils, catchment saturation is
            approached already during moderate to large storm events.
            Nevertheless, it should be conservatively assumed that only the CL

          adopted for Very Rare and PMP events. In the absence of any
          scientific justification, it is suggested that losses between the

          mm and that for the most Extreme design event (with an AEP of 1 in
          10<superscript>6</superscript>) is 0 mm, then Extreme loss values
          can be interpolated from a line drawn on log-Normal probability
          paper between 10 mm at 1 in 100 AEP and, say, 0.1 mm at 1 in

          <para>Very low values of IL<subscript>b</subscript> are recommended
          as it is assumed that the pre-burst rainfalls associated with the
          PMP design burst will either partly (longer duration bursts) or
          fully (short duration bursts) satisfy soil moisture deficits. In
          conformity with the adopted policy of aiming for reasonable
          conservatism in the absence of more relevant information,
          conservatively low estimates are generally recommended. For PMP
          design burst durations approaching the duration of the observed
          storms, the IL<subscript>b</subscript> value for use with the PMP
          should be equal to or possibly a little less than the minimum
          IL<subscript>b</subscript> value in large floods observed on the
          catchment. For significantly shorter burst durations, a zero value
          for IL<subscript>b</subscript> is recommended.</para>

          <para>In this context of selecting a design loss, some care and
          interpretation may be required in assessing the minimum value in
          observed floods. Sometimes an apparently anomalous value occurs that
          is appreciably lower than all other derived values. As this could
          have resulted from the effects of data errors, it may be desirable
          to neglect the anomalously low value in selecting the minimum
          value.</para>

          <para>General guidelines regarding the CL values to be used with PMP
          design bursts are given below for various regions of Australia,
          based on published data or local experience. With the general nature
          of the recommendations, it is not appropriate to delineate precise
          boundaries of the regions. Where possible, greatest reliance should
          be placed on values derived from several large observed floods on
          the catchment of interest, as discussed previously. Given the
          tendency of events of greater rainfall intensity to saturate greater
          proportions of the catchment, the largest events are expected to be
          associated with the smallest loss rates. Similarly, long duration
          events can be expected to be associated with lower CL values than
          short duration events. However, as noted above, any anomalously low
          values, thought to result from the effects of data errors in the
          volume balance computations, should be neglected.</para>

          <para>For short duration events, losses are very small compared with
          depths of precipitation, and variations in the value adopted will
          have little effect on the magnitude of the resulting flood. For
          longer storms, the rate of loss and the form of loss adopted can
          have a considerable effect on estimated floods, particularly on
          flood volumes, and greater care is needed in their selection. An
          example of the variation of maximum pond level with loss values is
          given by Brown (1982).</para>

        <para>Following the advice provided in <xref

        loss values recommended for rural catchments to pervious areas. For

      <title>General</title>

      <para>In Australia, both unit hydrograph models and runoff routing
      models have traditionally been applied for event-based flood hydrograph
      estimation but over the last decade there has been a shift to almost
      exclusive use of runoff routing models. In recent times attention has
      also been given to the use of “rain-on-grid” approaches with
      two-dimensional (2D) hydraulic models. Discussion on the general
      catchment modelling concepts and the application of hydrograph and
      catchment models to the estimation of design floods is provided in <xref
      linkend="book4"/>, <xref linkend="book5"/> and <xref
      linkend="book7"/>.</para>

      <para>The following discussion is focussed on the application of
      event-based runoff routing models to estimate Very Rare to Extreme
      floods, i.e. those design situations in which models are used to
      estimate floods well beyond the range for which they can be calibrated
      or their performance tested against observed floods. Guidance on the use
      of rain-on-grid approaches for estimation of Very Rare to Extreme floods
      is not provided here for two reasons: firstly, the techniques have not
      been well researched or validated at this point in time and appropriate
      guidance on their use for this purpose is provided in <xref
      linkend="book7"/>; secondly, such models are generally focussed on
      investigations for floodplain management where the estimation of flood
      risks for Extreme events is generally undertaken for performance check
      rather than design purposes.</para>

      <para>For event-based models, the quality of the modelled flood
      hydrographs depends on three components of the modelling process: (i)
      the basic model capabilities and constraints, (ii) the quality of the
      catchment representation in the model, and (iii) the appropriateness of
      the selected parameter values in the flood range of interest. General
      recommendations for these three components in the context of estimating
      Very Rare to Extreme floods are provided separately in <xref
      linkend="b8_s_zvvef"/> to <xref linkend="b8_s_fxgci"/>, but it should be
      recognised that the components are closely linked. The theoretical
      advantages of a more flexible model that allows a more accurate
      representation of the important catchment features can only be realised
      if suitable data or design information exists to identify appropriate
      model parameter values.</para>

      <para>In the application of runoff routing models, a distinction needs
      to be made between essentially rural catchments and substantially
      urbanised catchments. <xref linkend="b8_s_tbwiz"/> deals with the
      determination of model parameters for essentially rural catchments,
      while the special aspects of model parameterisation for urban catchments
      are dealt with in <xref linkend="b8_s_fxgci"/>.</para>

        extensions required for applications in situations where the

        more detailed modelling. The enhanced models form a sounder basis for
        extrapolation to extreme events. The importance of these modelling
        capabilities is somewhat dependent upon catchment size, and judgement
        is required to determine the extent to which the following issues need

          <para>Significant variation of routing characteristics over the

          a semi-distributed representation of routing elements in the
          catchment (see <xref linkend="book5"/>). The model should have the

          <para>While there is evidence of non-linear routing response over
          the range of observed floods in most natural catchments, it is
          unclear to what extent this effect persists to the range of Very
          Rare to Extreme floods. In this range of flood magnitudes the
          routing response depends on how the efficiency of flow and the
          available flood storage change with increasing flood magnitude (or
          reducing flood frequency). The recommended procedures in <xref

        <title>General Considerations</title>

        <para>Most hydrograph models are highly conceptual in nature; in
        setting up a model representation of the catchment, the modeller
        should therefore try to define conceptual model elements that match
        the routing response of the main components of the real catchment,
        without necessarily attempting to exactly match all physical catchment
        features (e.g. individual drainage lines, drainage divides) in detail.
        How this can best be achieved will depend on the specific features of
        the selected model. However, the most important factor determining the
        quality of the modelling results is the modeller’s understanding of
        the routing functions incorporated in the modelling package and
        his/her appreciation of the catchment response under major to extreme
        flood conditions. More specific guidance on selected model

          routing characteristics compared to the rest of the catchment,

          <title>Modelling of changed catchment conditions</title>

          <para>The effects of likely changes to the catchment during the
          design life of the structure need to be considered. Urbanisation and
          destruction of vegetation by clearing or fire may reduce the
          response time of the catchment and increase the peak flow, while
          soil conservation measures over a large portion of a catchment may
          have the opposite effect. The impacts of these changed catchment
          conditions on the formation and propagation of extreme floods is
          currently not well researched. Generally, a rather arbitrary
          allowance must be made for these effects. Construction of a
          reservoir may inundate appreciable lengths of streams in the
          catchment and can lead to large decreases in travel time and
          increases in flood peaks, despite the attenuation resulting from the
          routing effect of the reservoir. This effect is discussed and
          examples are given by Weeks and Stewart (1982), Brown (1982) and
          Watson (1982). The last two references give examples where the
          inflow flood peak is increased by 85% by the construction of a dam.
          It is therefore important to consider this effect when using a model
          to derive design floods for a dam if it has been calibrated to
          pre-dam conditions.</para>

          <para>In general, allowance for different catchment conditions can
          be made more easily by runoff routing than by unit hydrograph
          models. In runoff-routing models the different routing

          incorporated by the judicious selection of parameters and the types

        <title>General</title>

        <para>The provisions of the 1987 edition of ARR addressed the question
        of hydrograph model parameter selection for Large to Extreme events,
        based on the research results and experience available at that time
        (Pilgrim, 1986). There has been limited research since then to resolve
        the issue of the appropriate degree of model non-linearity for the
        estimation of Extreme flood events. Given the lack of strong research
        evidence, specific design recommendations for this range of events
        must be based on a consensus approach. The following considerations
        and recommendations are based on the broad range of views expressed by
        different groups of practitioners and current practice in
        Australia.</para>

        <para>The key factor to be considered when selecting parameters for
        modelling Very Rare to Extreme events is that the parameters found
        from calibration to a relatively narrow range of observed flood events
        cannot be assumed to apply to the range of more extreme events. As the
        magnitude of the event to be modelled increases significantly beyond
        the range of the largest observed events, the parameter selection
        process has to be guided more strongly by physical/hydraulic
        consideration of how the response of the catchment is expected to
        change when exposed to more extreme rainfall events. This will depend
        on the physical characteristics of hillslopes and on stream and
        floodplain characteristics such as breakout points, threshold levels
        and the availability of significant off-stream storage areas in the
        lower part of the catchment.</para>

        <para>It is necessary to provide recommendations for design situations
        in which suitable streamflow information may or may not be available.
        Accordingly, guidance on both these situations is provided in the
        following two sections. Subsequent sections provide specific guidance
        on other aspects of parameter determination, and are aimed at
        minimising the uncertainties in the selection of design parameter
        values. Guidance on the selection of parameter values for estimation
        of Very Rare to Extreme design floods in ungauged catchments is

          <title>Calibration to the Largest Observed Flood Events</title>

          <para>The simplified conceptual representation of catchment response
          in the commonly used flood hydrograph models means that these models
          rely heavily on appropriately calibrated parameter values. While
          calibration of a model provides valuable information on the flood
          response of a catchment within the range of observations, caution is
          needed when applying the model to estimate design floods of much
          larger magnitude. Extrapolation of model parameter values beyond the
          range of calibration events will introduce considerable uncertainty
          into flood estimates.</para>

          <para>The model should thus be calibrated to events over a range of
          flood magnitudes up to the largest observed event, and the results
          analysed for the presence of any trends. If appropriate data are not
          available at the site of interest, consideration should be given to
          transferring parameters from a calibrated model of a nearby
          catchment with similar characteristics, with appropriate adjustments
          for differences in catchment size and characteristics.</para>

          <para>The examination of log-log plots of storage versus discharge
          for particular routing elements may be helpful in the assessment of
          calibration results and in identifying parameter variation with
          flood magnitude. In assessing the calibration results, it should be
          borne in mind that the calibrated parameter values for individual
          events reflect not only the catchment response to actual rainfall,
          but also any errors in the estimated catchment rainfall, in the
          rating curve used to establish the observed flood hydrograph, and in
          the adopted baseflow separation procedure. The first two types of
          errors tend to increase with event magnitude.</para>

          <para>In catchments where a long series of at-site or regional flood
          data is available, the comparison of rainfall-based estimates with
          flood frequency based estimates can provide important information on
          the variation of flood response characteristics with flood
          magnitude. With this approach, in accordance with the general
          guidance provided in <xref linkend="book7"/>, the initial model
          parameter values found from calibration are adjusted to achieve
          reasonable agreement between the rainfall-based estimate for a
          selected AEP and the flood frequency analysis based estimate of
          corresponding AEP. Adjustment of hydrograph model parameters is only
          necessary if satisfactory agreement of flood estimates from the two
          methods cannot be achieved by varying loss parameters within
          reasonable limits. It may also be required, if the comparison
          indicates that the rainfall based method cannot satisfactorily

          <para>The lack of data on very large floods in the catchment of

          observations for very large events in catchments with similar

          <para>There are relatively few published hydrograph modelling
          studies of very large Australian flood events (Wong and Laurenson,
          1983; Pilgrim, 1986; Sriwongsitanon, et al., 1998). The available
          evidence points towards reducing non-linearity of catchment response
          for very large events (Pilgrim, 1986; Zhang and Cordery, 1999),
          indicating relatively more catchment storage for increasing
          discharge and thus greater attenuation of flood peaks. However, this
          tendency may not continue to the range of Extreme events, if flow
          efficiency also increases substantially for these events. The
          conclusion from these studies might also be affected by the high
          degree of uncertainty in estimated flow rates for Very Rare to
          Extreme events: the apparent tendency towards linearity could
          alternatively be explained by underestimation of the true peak flow

          <para>The most commonly applied runoff routing models in Australia
          use conceptual storage elements to represent the hydrograph
          formation process in response to distributed inputs of rainfall
          excess. These conceptual storages represent the routing response of
          all catchment components, from hillslopes to river channels and
          floodplains. Each storage element is represented by a power-function
          relationship between storage <emphasis role="italic">S</emphasis>
          and flow rate <emphasis role="italic">Q</emphasis>, with coefficient
          <emphasis role="italic">k</emphasis> and exponent <emphasis
          role="italic">m</emphasis> (<xref linkend="book5"/>). The exponent
          <emphasis role="italic">m</emphasis> expresses the degree of
          non-linearity in the catchment response; it typically varies between
          0.6 and 1.0, where a value of 1.0 corresponds to a linear response.
          Within a limited range of <emphasis role="italic">S</emphasis> and
          <emphasis role="italic">Q</emphasis>, different combinations of
          <emphasis role="italic">k</emphasis> and <emphasis
          role="italic">m</emphasis> can produce similar S-Q relationships,
          and the modelled flood outputs are not overly sensitive to the
          selection of a particular combination.</para>

          <para>While this simplified representation of the relationship
          between storage and discharge has been shown to produce satisfactory
          results over a limited range of flood magnitudes, it is well known
          that it fails to adequately represent the variations of flow
          conditions over a much wider range of flood magnitudes. As an
          example, it has been shown that the <emphasis
          role="italic">S-Q</emphasis> relationship for the transitional
          stages between in-bank and fully developed floodplain flow is much
          more complex (Wong and Laurenson, 1983; Bates and Pilgrim, 1983;
          Pilgrim, 1986). The failure of the power-function relationship
          between <emphasis role="italic">S</emphasis> and <emphasis
          role="italic">Q</emphasis> to account for these complexities
          expresses itself in different calibrated pairs of <emphasis
          role="italic">k</emphasis> and <emphasis role="italic">m</emphasis>
          values for different flow ranges.</para>

          <para>The available flood data provide good evidence for the nature
          of non-linearity in stream-channel and floodplain flow for Rare
          floods and possibly even Very Rare events. However, relatively

          beyond the range of relatively frequent events, or for Extreme
          floods in stream-channel and floodplain systems.</para>

          <para>In this situation of limited reliable evidence from very large

          topographic and hydraulic factors. An analysis of these factors for
          the different parts of the catchment may thus provide valuable
          information on the general form of the S-Q relationship. As an
          example, the hydraulic analysis of channel and flood plain flow
          characteristics may shed some light on the nature of non-linearity
          in the streamflow routing elements in the extreme flood range.
          Similar analyses may be undertaken for hillslope segments but the
          results will necessarily be associated with a greater degree of
          uncertainty.</para>

          <para>The interpretation of calibration results can be guided by
          consideration of special cases of the relationships between storage
          and discharge. For the case of steady, uniform flow in a prismatic
          channel, the analysis using Manning’s equation produces a power law
          relationship between <emphasis role="italic">S</emphasis> and
          <emphasis role="italic">Q</emphasis> with <emphasis
          role="italic">m</emphasis>-values ranging from 0.6, for a wide
          rectangular channel, to 0.75 for a triangular channel (Mein et al,
          1974). This assumes that the cross-sectional areas contributing to
          flow and to storage are identical, and that a <emphasis
          role="italic">constant Manning’s n</emphasis> applies to all
          magnitudes of flow. It implies that the average flow velocity is
          increasing with increasing event magnitude. Another special case
          applies when a <emphasis role="italic">constant average flow
          velocity</emphasis> can be assumed over the range of flood
          magnitudes, and flow and storage areas are again identical. This
          case corresponds to a power law relationship between <emphasis
          role="italic">S </emphasis>and <emphasis role="italic">Q</emphasis>
          with an <emphasis role="italic">m</emphasis>-value of 1.0, i.e. a
          linear relationship.</para>

      <title>Model Parameterisation for Urban Catchments</title>

      <para>Floods in urban catchments are the product of more complex
      interactions of hydrometeorological, hydrologic and hydraulic factors
      than in rural catchments. Severe floods can result from short duration
      intense rainfall over relatively small areas. The hydrologic response to
      heavy rainfalls is affected by changes to the natural runoff
      characteristics by reducing infiltration and increasing impervious
      surface areas. The drainage characteristics are changed by provision of
      more efficient flow paths in storm drain systems and channelised
      sections of streams. The hydraulic characteristics of drainage systems
      are also made more complex by the presence of bridges, culverts,
      floodways and detention basins.</para>

      <para>The degree of complexity required when modelling an urban system
      is largely dictated by the design context. If the main focus is on
      sizing trunk drainage capacities then it may be sufficient to use
      non-linear storage routing models, where appropriate attention is given
      to characterising the shorter relative delay times associated with
      urbanisation of the natural drainage paths. Many hydraulic controls that
      influence flood response in urban catchments become drowned out under
      extreme conditions, and the complexities required to model the
      performance of these systems under Very Frequent to Rare conditions may
      not be required for more extreme events.</para>

      <para>In complex systems it may not be possible to predict the changing
      nature of flow paths with event magnitude, or adequately characterise
      the influence of major floodplain features. In such cases it would be
      expected that flood behaviour is best assessed using hydraulic models,
      as described in <xref linkend="book6"/> and <xref linkend="book7"/>.
      However, while the use of such models better resolves the influence of
      hydraulic controls, they introduce additional complexity associated with
      the need to interface with the hydrologic models used to derive input
      hydrographs. The need for such an interface might be avoided by
      inputting rainfall directly onto the hydraulic model grid, but this is
      only possible for catchments where the model covers the whole
      contributing area. While this potentially provides a more realistic
      representation of catchment controls, the approach is not well validated
      at this point in time and is subject to additional uncertainties, as
      discussed in <xref linkend="book7"/>.</para>

      <para>The joint use of hydrologic and hydraulic routing models involves
      some explicit trade-offs in modelling complexity. On one hand hydrologic
      models are easily run within a joint-probability framework and are thus
      able to explicitly solve the joint probabilities involved in the
      production of flood runoff to yield unbiased estimates of flood risk. On
      the other, they are ill-suited to representing the influence of complex
      hydraulic controls that might arise in an urban environment under
      Extreme conditions.</para>

      <para>One means of balancing this trade-off is to use a hydraulic model
      to define the characteristics of a storage-discharge relationship. With
      this approach, a selection of flood hydrographs spanning the range of
      conditions of interest are input into the hydraulic model, and the
      outputs are then used to derive a relationship between storage,
      discharge and/or level, as relevant to the design problem of interest.
      This relationship can then be incorporated into a joint probability
      framework and then used to derive the flood characteristics without
      further need for hydraulic modelling. The advantage of the approach is
      that it combines the benefits of hydraulic modelling with stochastic
      simulation of flood processes but without impractical computational
      burden. The limitations of the approach is that it assumes that the
      derived storage-discharge relationship is adequate for all combinations
      of inputs, a situation that is only likely to be valid when considering
      one or two dominant mechanisms of flood loading. An example of this
      approach is provided by Sih et al (2012), who used the hydrologic model
      to resolve the joint probabilities involved in reservoir drawdown and
      the concurrence of flood inflows from two major tributaries, and a
      hydraulic model to relate tributary inflows and tide levels to peak
      water levels at locations within a complex urbanised floodplain.</para>

      <para>For more complex environments it will be necessary to rely
      directly on a hydraulic model to provide a realistic representation of
      flow behaviour. At present it is usually impractical to consider running
      complex hydraulic models in a stochastic simulation scheme, though it is
      expected that this approach will become increasingly feasible as
      parallel and distributed computing capabilities improve and become more
      easily implemented. The simplest way of trading off the potential for
      bias associated with rainfall-runoff modelling and the need for accurate
      representation of hydraulic behaviour is by careful selection of
      deterministic hydrologic inputs. For example, estimates of the
      concurrent peak design floods may be obtained through ensemble or Monte
      Carlo approaches, and these may be used to scale representative
      hydrographs for input to deterministic simulation in a hydraulic model.
      At its simplest, single runs of hydraulic models may be undertaken for
      each combination of storm duration and event severity, but this can be
      extended to ensemble hydraulic runs for a more representative range of
      flood inputs. The success of either approach rests on the selection of
      inputs that minimise bias in the transformation between rainfall
      exceedance probability and the flood level (or outflow) of interest, and
      sensitivity analyses will assist the identification of dominant
      influences and the selection of representative scenarios to be
      modelled.</para>

        <para>The available procedures can be divided into two main groups: those based on fitting a
          frequency curve to flood maxima, and those based on design rainfalls. Flood frequency
          methods (<xref linkend="b3_ch2"/>) are used to provide estimates of peak discharge, but
          perhaps their most valuable role in the context of this Book is to provide information
          that can be used to validate, or even calibrate, rainfall-based procedures. The limit of
          credible extrapolation for flood frequency analysis based on regional gauged data is
          perhaps 1 in 500 AEP (<xref linkend="b8_t_tbdlw"/>), though paleoflood analysis (<xref
            linkend="b8_s_aaq3x"/>) can be used to considerably extend this limit. The credible
          limit of flood frequency analysis that can be typically obtained using at-site data is
          perhaps only 1 in 50 AEP (<xref linkend="b8_t_tbdlw"/>).</para>

        <para>Rainfall-based procedures use loss models and hydrograph models
        to transform design rainfall inputs into design flood estimates. Final
        design estimates of Very Rare to Extreme floods, beyond the credible
        limit of extrapolation (of either rainfall or floods), should be
        derived using rainfall-based procedures. The design details in the
        following sections relate mainly to rainfall-based procedures. As
        discussed in <xref linkend="b1_ch3-1e"/>, event-based approaches are
        generally more applicable to the estimation of Very Rare to Extreme
        floods than are approaches based on continuous simulation;
        accordingly, the procedures as outlined in <xref linkend="book4"/>

        <para>In many cases, the flood hydrograph is required as well as the

        different configurations and combinations of conditions, which should
        all conform with the recommendations of ANCOLD (2000). The complete

        <title>Expected Probability Adjustment</title>

        <para>The concept of ‘expected probability’ and its application in
        practical design problems is explained in <xref linkend="b3_ch2_s5"/>.
        It denotes the expected value of the AEP of a given flood magnitude.
        The expected probability is influenced by the uncertainty in
        parameters used to estimate the flood magnitude. Where the expected
        probability has not been implicitly determined in the flood frequency
        analysis, an ‘expected probability adjustment’ to estimates of AEP can
        be applied subsequently to correct for any systematic bias in the
        estimated risk arising from parameter uncertainty.</para>

        <para>In principle, the issue of expected probability is of
        considerable importance to the estimation of Very Rare to Extreme
        floods, as the magnitude of the adjustment is greatest for design
        flood magnitudes that involve significant extrapolation beyond the
        flood sizes in the sample being analysed. Furthermore, in many
        applications, the interest is directly on the AEP of a given flood
        magnitude (e.g. the spillway capacity of an existing dam), rather than
        on the flood magnitude for a given design AEP (relevant to design of
        new structures with a standards-based approach).</para>

        <para>However, as indicated in <xref linkend="b3_ch2"/>, the question
        of when it is appropriate to apply an expected probability adjustment
        is a complex one, and the decision depends on a number of theoretical
        and practical considerations. In general, the estimates of risk for
        Rare to Extreme floods are not used in an absolute sense, but to allow
        comparison with established levels of acceptable risk, or to establish
        risk-based economic costs for comparative evaluation of
        options.</para>

        <para>It should be noted that use of the Total Probability Theorem to
        derive flood quantiles using Monte Carlo Event procedures as described
        in <xref linkend="book4"/> yields expected probability quantiles.
        This approach ensures probability-neutrality, at least for the set of
        hydrologic inputs used in its application. If estimates are derived
        from a blend of approaches, comments on the likely magnitude and
        importance of expected probability adjustments for different flood
        ranges are as follows:</para>

            expected probability adjustment would thus be relatively minor for
            the rainfall frequency distribution. However, there is usually
            significant extrapolation of the rainfall-runoff model. In such

        <para>The recommendations in this section apply only to the direct

        the consideration of other complicating factors. However, there may be
        some cases where some other set of circumstances may be critical for
        design. One example is dams with very large storages where it is
        necessary to take explicit account of initial storage level or
        rainfall sequences over very long durations. Another is the need to
        assess the likely rate of lake level rise to assist planning for
        emergency response purposes. The assessment of consequences on
        communities downstream of a dam may require consideration of
        concurrent floods in adjacent catchments. Also, a series of dams along
        a given stream requires special consideration, as failure of an

        than its normal design flood. It is the responsibility of the designer

        <para>The recommended methods for frequency analysis of Australian
        flood data are outlined in <xref linkend="b3_ch2"/>. When selecting
        suitable data and methods for flood frequency analyses in the context
        of this Book, it should be kept in mind that the specific interest is
        on the upper tail of flood frequency distributions. This requires
        careful scrutiny of the accuracy of the largest flood observations in
        relation to possible data problems, in particular the accuracy of
        rating curves in the extrapolated range. Analysis of annual flood
        series would generally be more appropriate than partial series and,
        where available, data on large historical floods should be
        incorporated in the analysis. Similarly, the value of limited flood
        data at the site of interest may be enhanced by combining the results
        of at-site frequency analysis and regional flood frequency analysis,
        using data from a number of sites within a homogeneous region. The
        special case of incorporating paleoflood data in the analysis is
        discussed briefly in <xref linkend="b8_s_aaq3x"/>.</para>

        <para>In principle, it is also possible to derive design flood
        estimates for a site downstream of a reservoir directly from flood
        frequency analysis of flood data available at that site. However, for
        reservoirs with large storage capacity compared to typical flood
        volumes, and with significant inter-event variability of reservoir
        flood storage, a much longer data series is required to adequately
        sample the combined effects of inflow and storage content variability.
        In these cases, the scope for extrapolation of directly determined
        flood frequency curves to the range of Large to Rare events is

        <title>Incorporation of Paleohydrological Estimates</title>

        <para>Paleohydrological estimates of floods are based on the study of
        the geomorphic and stratigraphic record of past floods, as well as
        evidence of past floods and streamflow derived from historical,
        archeological, dendrochronologic, or other sources. The advantage of
        paleohydrologic data (USBR, 1999) is that it is often possible to
        develop records that are 10 to 100 times longer than conventional or
        historical records from other data sources. This information thus has
        the potential to provide estimates of Very Rare flood peaks that are
        independent of rainfall-based procedures. Such information can provide

          <title>Preliminary Estimates of Peak Discharge</title>

          <para>One possible approach to deriving a frequency curve of peak

          flood frequency analysis and regional methods (<xref
          linkend="b3_ch2"/> and <xref linkend="b3_ch3"/>), and for the PMP
          Flood. Preliminary estimates of the PMP Flood can be conservatively
          approximated by estimates of the PMF. Regional prediction equations
          for the PMF are available for some regions (eg Nathan et al., 1994;
          Pearce et al, 2011<superscript>b</superscript>; Malone, 2011; Smythe
          and Cox, 2006), though envelope curves for world floods may also
          provide useful information (Herschy, 2003). The preliminary
          estimates of the PMP Flood are plotted at the relevant AEP of PMP
          for the catchment using the recommendations provided in <xref
          linkend="b8_s_bb68z"/>. These flood estimates can then be used to
          construct a frequency curve based on a log-Normal approximation, ie
          by fitting a straight line through the flood peaks in the
          logarithmic domain and probability as a standardised normal variate.
          Previous guidance (Nathan and Weinmann, 1999) recommended use of
          shape factors to define intermediate quantiles, but use of a simple
          log-Normal relationship should be sufficient as long as due regard
          is given to the large uncertainties involved.</para>

          time and effort in application than estimates of peak discharge,

        <title>Derivation of Complete Design Flood Frequency Curve</title>

        <para>The shape of the complete flood frequency curve in the Rare to
        Extreme event is largely determined by the shape of the design
        rainfall frequency curve described in <xref linkend="b8_ch3"/>. Design
        rainfall inputs for specified AEPs are then converted to flood outputs
        in a probability-neutral fashion, as discussed above. For each AEP,
        flood outputs for a range of different durations have to be
        determined, and the one that gives the highest peak discharge
        (corresponding to the critical duration) is generally adopted. Minor
        adjustment of design inputs or smoothing of derived design floods for
        different critical durations may be required to obtain a smooth flood
        frequency curve. It is expected that estimates of Rare to Very Rare
        floods represent the “best estimate” obtained from multiple methods,
        as described in the preceding section.</para>

        <para>While the focus of the guidance in this Book is on Very Rare to
        Extreme flood events, it is important to check that the models yield
        estimates that are consistent with available evidence. Estimates of
        Rare floods provide the “anchor point” for derivation of more extreme
        events, and it is advisable to select a best estimate by weighting the
        estimates obtained from different methods by their uncertainty. In
        practice, however, the information required to do this is limited and
        it is recommended that where possible rainfall-based estimates are
        reconciled with independent estimates from flood frequency analysis or
        regional flood models estimates (<xref linkend="b3_ch2"/> &amp; <xref
        linkend="b3_ch3"/>).</para>

        <para>An example of such reconciliation is illustrated in <xref
        linkend="b8_f_sw31s"/>. In this example the independent estimates are
        obtained from flood frequency analysis of observed annual maxima; the
        initial rainfall-based estimates were obtained from calibration of
        model parameters to historical floods (dashed red line, <xref
        linkend="b8_f_sw31s"/>), and the loss parameters were then adjusted
        within their expected range to better align with the results obtained
        from flood frequency analysis (solid red line). As discussed in <xref
        linkend="b8_s_20a81"/>, reconciliation is best achieved by adjustment
        of the loss parameters within reasonable limits where routing
        parameters are obtained from fitting to historical floods. Ideally,
        the loss parameters should be reconciled jointly with quantiles based
        on flood peaks as well as flood volumes, where the duration over which
        flood volumes are calculated correspond to the critical duration of
        interest (eg the duration of a storm that yields maximum levels in a
        storage). The objective of such reconciliation is to adjust loss
        parameters within reasonable bounds to achieve a result that is
        reasonably consistent with both flood peak and flood volume quantiles,
        allowing for uncertainty in these estimates and the final best
        estimates based on consideration of both approaches should reflect the
        relative weight given to each approach for the range of AEPs of
        interest.</para>

        <para>In reconciling differences in flood estimates from
        rainfall–based and flood frequency procedures, the assumptions behind
        each procedure should be carefully examined. For example with
        rainfall-based procedures, there is very little known about the manner
        in which non-linearity changes with flood magnitude, and the
        differences between design flood estimates may easily be explained by
        different assumptions regarding non-linearity. Similarly, certain
        assumptions will be inherent in the available period of flood record
        and quality of the rating curve. Ideally, the uncertainties should be
        explicitly evaluated to determine confidence limits, but in practice,
        sensitivity analysis of design inputs/parameters within expected
        limits will need to suffice.</para>

      <title>Estimation of the Probable Maximum Flood</title>

      <section xml:id="b8_s_6e5at">
        <title>Design Context</title>

        <para>The Probable Maximum Flood (PMF) is a hypothetical flood
        estimate relevant to a specific catchment whose magnitude is such that
        there is negligible chance of being exceeded. It represents a notional
        upper limit of flood magnitude and no attempt is made to assign a
        probability of exceedance to such an event. The concept of the PMF has
        been an important element in design flood standards for dams in the
        United States and Australia over the past 60 to 70 years (Myers, 1967;
        Brown, 1982; ANCOLD, 2000). It is commonly used in many other
        countries (ICOLD, 1991), though there are some countries, such as
        Russia, with little experience of the method and where preference is
        given to probabilistic methods (Zhirkevich and Asarin, 2010).</para>

        <para>The PMF is also used to define the extent of flood-prone land
        (Australian Emergency Management Institute, 2014). The extent, nature
        and potential consequences of flooding associated with a range of
        events up to and including the PMF event is considered in some
        floodplain management studies. The PMF causes the largest scale of
        flood emergency and is also therefore often used for emergency
        management planning (Australian Emergency Management Institute,
        2014).</para>

        <para>Pilgrim and Rowbottom (1987) defined the PMF as the limiting
        value of flood that could <emphasis
        role="italic">reasonably</emphasis> be expected to occur.
        Superimposing risks of very low probabilities was not considered
        reasonable, but it was considered prudent to incorporate some degree
        of conservatism. While it is possible to estimate an upper limiting
        value of flood magnitude, the estimation of its AEP is subject to even
        greater uncertainty than that of the PMP. Conservatively estimated
        (reasonably possible) values of the factors involved in the
        transformation of the PMP to the PMF introduce a shift in probability
        but, because the phrase “reasonably possible” is a qualitative
        description of probability, the AEP of the resulting flood varies
        depending on the degree of conservatism adopted. In practice, the
        magnitude of the PMF will be greater than the magnitude of the flood
        derived from the PMP using a transformation based on
        probability-neutral objectives, but its AEP will be smaller.</para>

        <para>Concerns around the difficulties of estimating the PMF in a
        consistent manner have been recognised for a long while (eg, Newton,
        1982, Barker et al, 1996; Nathan and Weinmann, 2004; Zielinski, 2009;
        Nathan et al, 2011). While the notion of a “probable maximum” flood
        standard appears a simple enough concept, in practice its estimation
        is confounded by a number of key problems (Nathan and Weinmann, 2004),
        namely:</para>

        <title>General Guidance</title>

        <para>In the derivation of the PMF, the probability-neutral objective
        for selection of design inputs is explicitly rejected in favour of
        adopting conservatively high estimates. With regard to losses, the
        general recommendations provided in <xref linkend="b8_s_zl6ib"/>
        should be adopted, i.e. losses should be equal to or possibly a little
        less than the minimum value in large floods observed on the catchment.
        In all cases, losses are likely to be low; in many regions of
        Australia a burst initial loss value of zero and a continuing loss
        rate of 1 mm/hr will be appropriate. If pre-burst temporal patterns
        are used to represent complete storms, then it would be expected that
        the storm initial losses would be greater than zero, but at the lower
        end of the range of losses adopted for estimation of the PMP
        Flood.</para>

        <para>The temporal patterns used to derive the PMF should be selected
        from an ensemble of patterns appropriate for use with the Generalised
        PMP (<xref linkend="b8_s_4n0lw"/>). Rearrangement of rainfall
        intensities within the patterns to give the highest possible flood
        peak may yield rainfall patterns with implausible serial correlation
        structure and is at variance with the objective of deriving a limiting
        value of flood that could reasonably occur. An estimate of a
        reasonable upper limiting value of floods may be derived by using the
        temporal (or spatially varying temporal) pattern from the available
        ensemble that yields the maximum flood characteristic of interest. It
        should be recognised that temporal and space-time patterns of rainfall
        based on historical events (<xref linkend="b2_ch4"/>) are usually
        based on a limited number of pluviometers; when scaled to PMP storms
        over large catchments such patterns may yield embedded bursts of
        rainfall that are quite unrealistic. Accordingly, the characteristics
        of the PMF derived using a single temporal (or space-time) pattern
        should be checked against the results obtained from other patterns in
        the available ensemble. If the difference between the maximum adopted
        pattern and other results is anomalously large, then it may be
        appropriate to adopt a less severe pattern so as not to superimpose
        inputs of very low probabilities.</para>

        <para>The hydrograph models used to transform the PMP to the PMF
        should follow the general recommendations provided in <xref
        linkend="b8_s_zvvef"/> and <xref linkend="b8_s_cd813"/>. Parameter
        values should be selected in accordance with the recommendations
        provided in <xref linkend="b8_s_tbwiz"/>. The selection of other
        design inputs, such as initial reservoir level or snowpack depth,
        should be representative of the more extreme conditions that could
        reasonably be expected to occur.</para>

        <title>Assessment of Reasonableness</title>

        <para>The derivation of a PMF in floodplain management studies is
        quite straightforward as generally the information is only used to
        assess the upper bound of potential inundation. In Australia, the 1 in
        100 AEP flood is often used to define levels of tolerable risk, and
        floodplain management activities are thus largely insensitive to the
        level of conservatism used to derive the PMF.</para>

        <para>However, PMFs are most often used in the context of assessing
        dam safety. The cost implications of upgrading dams may well be very
        sensitive to the degree of conservatism adopted by practitioners when
        assessing the “reasonableness” of assumptions used to derive the PMF.
        For example, as illustrated in <xref linkend="b8_f_xy0k6"/>a (dashed
        curve), the costs of providing additional flood capacity may increase
        monotonically with flood magnitude; under such a scenario there is no
        obvious point where the upgrade costs increase disproportionally with
        the degree of conservatism adopted. However, if there is a step
        function involved in the relationship between flood capacity and cost
        – for example if an additional spillway is required because the
        practical limit of extending a wave wall has been reached (solid curve
        in <xref linkend="b8_f_xy0k6"/>a) – then a small difference in
        subjective judgement may have a significant impact on the costs and
        feasibility of an upgrade.</para>

          <title>(a) Differential importance of “reasonableness” in PMF

        <para>It is clearly undesirable that small differences in subjective
        assessments of “reasonableness” might have a large impact on design
        costs. Accordingly, in some situations it will be prudent to
        explicitly examine the impact of any subjective hydrological
        judgement, and the final decision regarding the appropriate level of

      <title>Treatment of Uncertainty</title>

      <para>Uncertainties in the estimation of extreme floods have important
      economic and social consequences, and thus recognition of the impacts of
      uncertainty should be incorporated into advice given to management and
      political decision makers. If there are significant differences in
      outcome within the range of uncertainty then the likely range of
      consequences should be explicitly considered when developing mitigation
      strategies and advice. An under-estimate of the flood magnitude will
      lead to the infrastructure being under-designed, thus potentially
      resulting in increased flood damage costs and possible loss of life.
      Conversely, an over-estimate of the flood magnitude will lead to extra
      costs from the over-design of the infrastructure.</para>

      <para>General guidance on techniques for characterising uncertainty is
      presented in <xref linkend="book7"/>. In the context of this Book, it
      should be stressed that the uncertainty or flood estimation error
      increases with increasing size of flood (or reducing AEP) and the
      relative impacts of different sources of uncertainty also change with
      flood magnitude. Uncertainty in the AEP of the PMP becomes increasingly
      important beyond the credible limit of extrapolation, and so does the
      epistemic uncertainty associated with the increasing lack of evidence to
      support the process descriptions of salient factors (eg temporal and
      spatial characteristics of rainfall) and model structure (eg degree of
      non-linearity in flood behaviour).</para>

      <para>The estimation of Very Rare to Extreme floods is a region where
      “the computation of hydrologic probabilities is based on arbitrary
      assumptions about the probabilistic behaviour of hydrologic processes
      rather than on empirical evidence or theoretical knowledge and
      understanding of these processes” (Klemes, 1993). Improving the
      consistency of the manner in which such assumptions are applied in
      practice will thus minimise the potential for differences in the results
      obtained by different hydrologists. The main strategy available for
      reducing the impact of this form of uncertainty is to ensure that the
      practitioners undertaking the work are appropriately qualified and
      supervised. In addition, prescriptive procedures relating to the
      estimation of floods beyond the credible limit of extrapolation are
      justifiable as without empirical evidence or scientific justification
      there can be little rational basis for departing from a consensus
      approach.</para>

    <title>Special Design Considerations</title>

    <section xml:id="b8_s_hlaxl">
      <title>General</title>

      <para>There are a number of special considerations that are relevant to
      some design situations and the following sections detail some of the
      more common issues that may need to be considered. The importance of
      these considerations, and hence the complexity of the techniques
      required to adequately address the issues, is very much dependent on the
      characteristics of the specific design problem. For example, where the
      storage volume of a reservoir is large compared to the volume of
      catchment runoff, the choice of initial starting levels in the reservoir
      is likely to have a more significant impact on the outcome of the study
      than the selection of runoff-routing parameter values.</para>

      <para>One design objective of general importance is the derivation of
      floods of specified AEP. Satisfying this objective generally requires
      the adoption of probability-neutral inputs i.e., the selection and/or
      treatment of design inputs to ensure that any bias in the AEP of the
      transformation between rainfall and runoff is minimised. The issues
      considered in this section are generally aimed at the more rigorous
      treatment of the joint probabilities involved in the selection of design
      inputs. However, as discussed in <xref linkend="b8_s_2vj4c"/>, it should
      be recognised that the defensibility of these estimates rests upon the
      representativeness of the selected inputs and the correct treatment of
      correlations which may be present.</para>

      <para>The appropriate level of complexity to be adopted is dependent
      upon the sensitivity of the design outcome to the input. Accordingly it
      is not possible to provide recommendations that are applicable to all
      design situations. The procedures recommended here are relevant to many
      situations, but they should be regarded as providing only a general
      guide to recommended practice. The practitioner is thus encouraged to
      adopt different procedures if they have a sound theoretical

        <para>The attenuation of an inflow hydrograph as it passes through a

        divided into two parts: the storage above the normal full supply level
        (flood storage) and the drawdown below full supply level at the onset
        of a flood (initial drawdown, or air-space). The flood storage for a
        given inflow hydrograph is a fixed system characteristic determined by
        the adopted spillway and freeboard characteristics of the storage, but
        the initial drawdown or initial reservoir level is a stochastic
        variable.</para>

        <para>The selection of an appropriate initial reservoir level is of
        considerable importance in determination of spillway adequacy. In
        particular, it is an important consideration in the determination of
        criteria related to the flood capacity of the dam, such as the Dam
        Crest Flood and the Imminent Failure Flood (ANCOLD, 2000). In many
        cases it may be appropriate to adopt a full reservoir level, but if
        there is a reasonable chance that the reservoir may be drawn down, and
        if the volume of drawdown is significant compared to the volume of the
        inflow floods of interest, then it will be desirable to analyse in
        more detail the effect on estimates of the frequencies of a particular
        peak outflow of the variation in storage volume. Where there is a
        strongly seasonal variation of storage volume, it may be necessary to
        undertake a seasonal analysis of storage impacts on outflow
        floods.</para>

          <para>Laurenson (1974) developed a method for the analysis of
          systems which incorporate both stochastic and deterministic
          components (in this context, the joint probabilities of the inflow
          and initial storage volume represent the stochastic component, and
          the relationship between the magnitudes of inflow and outflow floods
          represent the deterministic component). Laurenson’s method provides
          a rigorous means of solving the joint probabilities involved, though
          it is not easily automated and is not well suited to accommodating
          correlations that may exist between the stochastic
          components.</para>

          <para>The analysis of the joint probabilities of storage contents
          and inflows is just one example of the more generic solution offered
          by Monte Carlo methods. Accordingly, if the rainfall-runoff
          modelling is undertaken in a Monte Carlo framework, then this is
          easily extended to consider reservoir outflows.</para>

          <para>Application of either method is straightforward as long as the
          probabilities of all the inputs can be appropriately defined; some
          care is required to ensure that the distributions are representative
          of the design conditions of interest, though in most situations
          where it is worthwhile undertaking the analysis the required
          information can usually be derived. The guidance below first covers
          specification of the input distributions as this is common to both

          ones represents a compromise between efficiency and accuracy of
          computations. A total of around 20 to 30 class intervals is
          generally sufficient, but they need to be well distributed over the
          range of possible variate values to ensure accuracy in the most
          important part of the range. Each interval is then represented by
          the variate value at the mid-point of the interval and by the width
          of the interval on the probability scale. The total probability of
          all the intervals must add up to unity. It is worth considering the
          following issues when discretising the distributions:</para>

              Equal intervals in the standard domain equate to unequal

          <title>Laurenson’s Analytical Solution</title>

          <para>The analytical solution proposed by Laurenson involves the
          convolution of the conditional probability distribution of outflows
          with the distribution of the conditioning event. In principle, the
          conditioning event may be either the reservoir inflow or the initial
          storage volume, but reservoir inflow is adopted in most
          applications. In practice the convolution is achieved by approximate
          numerical methods, based on discrete approximations to the
          continuous probability distributions of the inflows and the
          outflows. To this end, the total range of inflows and outflows has
          to be divided into a finite number of class intervals.</para>

          <para>The conditional probability of a specified outflow event occurring, given that the
            conditioning event is in a specific class interval, can be determined using a
            deterministic relationship between inflows, outflows, and storage volume (the I-S-Q
            relationship). The I-S-Q relationship has to be determined for a range of peak inflows
            (corresponding to a range of design rainfalls for selected exceedance probabilities) and
            for a set of initial storage values. The process of computing the conditional
            probability of a specified outflow event is illustrated in <xref linkend="b8_f_17uij"/>
            for the case where the reservoir inflow was chosen as the conditioning event and the
            initial storage volume as the secondary variable. From this figure it is seen that the
            conditional probability of a specified outflow event is evaluated as the width of the
            storage volume probability interval
              (P[Q<subscript>j</subscript>|I<subscript>i</subscript>]) that translates an inflow in
            the interval Ii into an outflow in the interval Q<subscript>j</subscript>.</para>

          <para>As different design rainfall durations result in different
          I-S-Q relationships, the computed value of the storage volume
          probability interval will also depend on the rainfall duration used.
          The critical rainfall duration to be used in the analysis is the one
          that translates into the highest outflow; this also produces the
          largest estimate of conditional outflow probability. Unfortunately
          the critical rainfall duration varies with reservoir drawdown, and
          in some cases it is necessary to compute separate I-S-Q
          relationships for different durations, and to derive an outflow
          frequency curve as the envelope of frequency curves derived for
          different durations.</para>

          <para>Another complication is that the above formulation assumes
          that the two distributions of storage volume and inflows are
          independent. This may not be the case, and if such correlation is
          found to be significant then the calculations must be based on the
          appropriate conditional selection of input variables.</para>

          <para>The evaluation of the I-S-Q relationship is the most time
          consuming element of the process. Many tens of individual runs are
          required to define the I-S-Q relationship in sufficient detail,
          though it is possible to automate the processing of different
          initial starting levels. The computation of the conditional
          probabilities is readily undertaken using spreadsheet software and
          is not resource intensive.</para>

          <para>The derivation of the outflow frequency curve by Laurenson’s
          (1974) joint probability approach involves the calculation of a
          transition probability matrix. Each element in this matrix
          represents the conditional probability of an inflow within the given
          inflow interval resulting in an outflow in a specified interval.
          Depending on the degree of non-linearity of the spillway rating
          curve, outflows may be discretised into class intervals of equal
          magnitude, or else intervals can be selected to provide more
          accuracy in the region of interest (e.g. for flows just above and
          below the spillway capacity). The total probability of an outflow in
          that interval can then be obtained as the sum of the probabilities
          over all the inflow intervals, i.e. all the inflow and initial
          storage combinations that produce an outflow in the specified range.
          Outflow AEPs are then computed as the cumulative probability over
          all outflow ranges exceeding the flood magnitude of interest.</para>

          line, lower left panel). It should be noted that it is not necessary
          to define the extreme tails of the drawdown distribution as the
          largest outflows are primarily driven by extreme rainfalls, where
          initial reservoir levels are most likely to be within the central
          range of exceedance. If the distribution of initial drawdown is
          assumed independent of extreme event rainfalls then it will only be

        occurs with hydropower schemes, but also arises with storages used for
        water supply. The complexity of analysis required depends on the size
        of the upstream storages and the degree of inter-dependence in their

        <para>In some design situations it is desirable to determine the flow

        <para>There are a number of methods available for the assessment of concurrent flows (see,
          for example, Green, 1996; Stephens et al, 2012). In the context of risk analysis it is
          important to focus on those methods that yield probability-neutral estimates. In essence,
          the issue of concurrent flooding is another joint-probability problem, and the method of
          Laurenson (1974) described in <xref linkend="b8_s_no8ga"/> can be applied directly to the

          marginal distribution of storage volume is replaced by the probability distribution of
          flows in the adjacent tributary. Careful consideration needs to be given to the
          specification of the marginal distribution of tributary inflows as the two flow
          distributions will be correlated. Also, peak discharges are unlikely to coincide. The
          worked example provided on this approach provided in <xref linkend="b8_s_9kcec"/> is
          directly applicable to this situation and can be applied if desired.</para>

        <para>Monte Carlo techniques also provide a rigorous solution to the
        problem. If space-time patterns of rainfall are used in the modelling
        then an unbiased estimated of the frequency distribution of tributary
        inflows can be obtained by application of the Total Probability
        Theorem as described in <xref linkend="book4"/>. An example of this
        approach is described by Jordan et al (2014). However, it may be that
        the tributary inflows are located well downstream of the catchment
        being modelled, and if this is the case then it may be easier to
        estimate concurrent flows using a more explicit scheme, as described
        below.</para>

        the magnitude of the tributary flows are minor compared to the
        mainstream flows, and the correlation between the two flows is small
        or modest. It is worth noting that the magnitudes of the tributary
        floods are very sensitive to the strength of the correlation, and thus
        careful attention should be given to the nature and selection of the
        events used to derive the correlation value. It is also perhaps worth
        noting that the tributary distribution of interest is the flow value
        coinciding with the peak flows in the mainstream; the use of the peak
        flow distribution for the tributaries is an additional
        approximation.</para>

        <title>Need for Seasonal Estimates</title>

        <para>In some situations Rare to Extreme design floods may be required
        for specific seasons within the year. Seasonal estimates may need to
        be investigated if it is suspected that the design factors of interest
        do not have an equal chance of occurring throughout the year, and that
        certain combinations of factors are unlikely to occur in the same
        season. For example, seasonal estimates may be required to assess the
        consequences of dam failure when the population at risk may be
        dependent on the time of year (e.g. summer holidays). The likelihood
        of snowmelt is an obvious example, though this will only need to be
        considered if a large proportion of the catchment lies above the
        snowline. Perhaps the most commonly encountered example is related to
        the evaluation of spillway adequacy, where the largest seasonal floods
        may coincide with the largest expected drawdown in the reservoir
        (Weinmann and Nathan, 1997).</para>

        <para>As discussed in <xref linkend="b8_s_9piio"/>, there are a number
        of conceptual and theoretical problems associated with the derivation
        of seasonal design rainfalls. Accordingly, seasonal design floods
        should only be derived if preliminary investigations indicate that the
        seasonal factors of interest have an appreciable impact on the
        required design outcome.</para>

        careful consideration needs to be given to the determination of losses
        and the manner in which design flood estimates are validated.</para>

        <para>Given a set of seasonal frequency curves, care needs to be given
        to converting the seasonal exceedance probabilities to annual
        estimates. The AEP of a specific event (e.g. a dam overtopping event,
        Q<subscript>0</subscript>) which is not conditional on the time of
        year can be approximated by summing the seasonal exceedance
        probabilities of the selected event.</para>

        (Q&gt;Q<subscript>0</subscript>). If these events are regarded as

      <title>Consideration of Snowmelt</title>

      <section xml:id="b8_s_njxh3">
        <title>Overview</title>

        <para>Snowmelt can have an appreciable impact on the timing and
        magnitude of floods, though there are only a small number of areas in
        Australia where it needs to be considered. A large number of different
        methods are available for estimating snowmelt. The variety of
        available methods reflects the different purposes for which they have
        been developed, and the different data resources available for their
        use. While there is a considerable body of literature concerned with
        the simulation and quantification of snowmelt processes, there is
        unfortunately little guidance on estimating the snowmelt component of
        design floods.</para>

        <para>The snowmelt algorithms used in the established flood event
        models can be broadly divided into two groups. One group of models is
        based on a <emphasis role="italic">temperature index
        approach</emphasis> in which temperature alone is used as a surrogate
        for the energy available for snowmelt. Another group of snowmelt
        algorithms is based on an <emphasis role="italic">energy balance
        approach</emphasis> in which energy fluxes are calculated explicitly
        using physically-based process equations. The results of an
        international comparison of snowmelt runoff models (World
        Meteorological Organisation, 1986b) indicate that the temperature
        index approach has an accuracy comparable to more complex energy
        budget formulations. Unfortunately, however, the method does not lend
        itself to hourly computations (which are required for flood event
        estimation purposes) because it is the radiation component which is
        mainly responsible for the hour-to-hour variations (Rango and
        Martinec, 1995).</para>

      <section xml:id="b8_s_d9b5r">
        <title>Selection of Snowmelt Model</title>

        <para>The selection of an appropriate method for snowmelt estimation
        is subject to the following two conflicting requirements: (i) the need
        to model as accurately as possible the snowmelt process; and, (ii) the
        need to adopt a parsimonious model for use in design. The resolution
        of these two conflicting requirements is a common problem in
        engineering hydrology, and the accepted philosophy of approach is to
        match model complexity with the nature of the available data. While
        the adoption of a complex, physically-based model may appear
        theoretically appropriate, in practice without the data to confirm
        component processes such models may perform no better than
        over-parameterised conceptual models. Parsimony in design snowmelt
        estimation is particularly important because, compared to rain-only
        flood event models, there is a considerable increase in the number of
        factors that influence the transfer from rainfall to runoff. The
        salient factors depend on the nature of the transfer function used,
        but in general it is necessary to consider carefully the inputs
        related to initial depth and density of the snowpack, the nature and
        duration of antecedent conditions prior to the rainfall event,
        windspeed, and the temperature sequence.</para>

        <para>The most appropriate method to use for the derivation of
        snowmelt design floods will depend largely on the nature of the
        available data. Practitioners are encouraged to review carefully the
        type of data that can be obtained for the site of interest, and to
        select a model that is commensurate with the complexity of the
        available data. A number of suitable models are commercially available
        (e.g. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 1990; Quick, 1993), though there
        is little documented experience with their application to Australian
        conditions.</para>

      <section xml:id="b8_s_6cx3y">
        <title>Application to Extreme Events</title>

        <para>It is general international practice to maximise all salient
        factors contributing to rain-on-snow runoff (e.g. US Army Corps of
        Engineers, 1960; NERC, 1975; Bergström et al., 1996). Typically, the
        antecedent snowpack is set equal to the depth and areal extent
        corresponding to an extreme event with an AEP of around 1 in 100, and
        the wind speed and temperature sequences are selected to maximise
        runoff. However, such approaches are not consistent with the
        probability-neutral approach, and thus careful consideration needs to
        be given to the selection of inputs to ensure that no probability bias
        is introduced into the transformation between rainfall and runoff. The
        magnitude of snowmelt floods is particularly sensitive to initial
        snowpack conditions, and accordingly it is likely that a joint
        probability approach would be required to satisfy probability-neutral
        requirements.</para>

        <para>Nathan and Bowles (1997) provide one example of a study in which
        a joint probability approach was adopted for the derivation of
        snowmelt design floods. They incorporated the Snow Compaction
        Procedure (USBR, 1966) into a modified version of the RORB model. This
        procedure uses a water budget approach which is based on the concept
        of snow compaction and a threshold density, where the maximum
        potential rate of snowmelt is derived using the sub-daily application
        of the US Corps of Engineers degree-day snowmelt equations (U.S. Army
        Corps of Engineers, 1960). A simplified approach was taken to sample
        antecedent snowpack conditions, but this would be better implemented
        within a Monte-Carlo framework.</para>

      <title>Consideration of Long Duration Events</title>

      <para>As discussed in <xref linkend="b8_s_ob5bq"/>, there are some
      design situations in which it appears that the critical duration of
      interest may be longer than the durations for which generalised design
      rainfall information are available (168 hours). The longest available
      design storm durations generally relate to the meteorological limits
      associated with single storm events, and thus longer duration design
      events will involve the consideration of storm sequences.</para>

      <para>While it may be necessary to consider the likelihood of storm
      sequences in tropical regions, it is reasonably clear that long duration
      design events (one to several days) in southeastern Australia are
      unlikely to be preceded by significant antecedent rainfalls (<xref
      linkend="b8_s_ob5bq"/>). Accordingly, the issue of storm sequences over
      extended periods may be implicitly solved by undertaking a joint
      probability analysis of inflow floods and reservoir volume, as described
      in <xref linkend="b8_s_no8ga"/>.</para>

      <para>There are other design situations (such as tailings dams) in which
      the design objective is to ensure that the risk of spills from the
      storage is negligible. These types of problems can generally be handled
      by undertaking mass balance calculations of all operational inflows and
      outflows for very long hydroclimatic sequences. It is usually not
      necessary to use a hydrograph model to route the rainfall excess as the
      surface area of the storage may be large compared to the contributing
      catchment area; it thus may be sufficient to allow for a freeboard in
      the storage that fully accommodates the volume of runoff corresponding
      to the required AEP of rainfall. This type of problem does not lend
      itself to event-based joint probability analyses but requires water
      balance computations over extended periods. Generally it is desirable to
      generate the long hydroclimatic sequences by stochastic data generation
      techniques (see McMahon and Mein, 1986), and an example of this approach
      used for spillway design is provided by Kinkela and Pearce (2014). The
      required security against overtopping can be achieved by using sequences
      of different lengths, as described for example in Grayson et al. (1996,
      <xref linkend="b8_s_zvvef"/>).</para>

      <para>One of the major practical and theoretical problems with the
      application of stochastic data generation techniques – particularly when
      used in the assessment of the Very Rare to Extreme risks – is the
      characterisation of statistical extremes. This difficulty relates both
      to the tail of the distribution, as well as to the definition of the
      correlation between the stochastic inputs over a range of event
      magnitudes. These issues require careful consideration and should only
      be undertaken by practitioners with specialist experience.</para>

      <title>Impact of Climate Change</title>

      <para>Estimates of Very Rare to Extreme rainfalls (and the resulting
      floods) are subject to change as our understanding of the governing
      physical processes increases, and as more data becomes available for
      analysis. The estimates are also subject to change due to long-term
      climatic variations, such as would result from changes in atmospheric
      concentration of greenhouse gases.</para>

      <para>General guidance on assessing the impact of climate change is
      provided in <?oxy_custom_start type="oxy_content_highlight" color="255,255,0"?>Book
      X Chapter X<?oxy_custom_end ?>, however it is worth noting that at
      present no allowance is made for climate change in estimates of the PMP.
      The Bureau of Meteorology completed an analysis of a storm database
      covering the period 1893 to 2001 and concluded that there is little
      evidence to support the notion that tropical cyclones (connected to
      major rainfall events) are penetrating further south or have become more
      frequent (Jakob et al, 2008). At time of writing the Bureau of
      Meteorology are not intending to revise PMP estimates or methodology to
      account for effects of climate change. Similarly, in north America
      standard procedures do not presently allow for climate change
      adjustments (Micovic et al, 2015), however climate model simulations and
      analysis of conceptual models of relevant meteorological systems would
      suggest that PMP estimates will increase in the future (Kunkel et al,
      2013; Stratz and Hossein, 2014). This is an area of active ongoing
      research and it might be expected that guidance will evolve in the
      future as better information becomes available.</para>

      <para>There are other factors apart from rainfall intensities that can
      be considered when assessing the impact of climate change. In the
      context of Very Rare to Extreme events, Fowler et al (2010) considered
      the impacts on two additional factors on the assessment of spillway
      adequacy, namely catchment losses and the distribution of water levels.
      The change in catchment losses was assessed by use of a continuous
      simulation model to derive streamflow sequences corresponding to
      current-day and changed-climate conditions; design losses were altered
      to achieve a match between quantiles of 4-day flood volumes obtained
      from Monte Carlo analysis and the frequency analysis of the derived
      maxima. Similarly, an altered distribution of drawdown conditions was
      obtained from a model that simulated altered irrigation demands and
      streamflow sequences. While that study found an overall reduction in
      flood risk due to the downward shift in distribution of initial storage
      levels, it would be expected that outcomes will vary depending on the
      characteristics of the system being modelled.</para>

      <para>Until better information becomes available it is considered that
      assessments of the impact of climate change on Very Rare to Extreme
      flood risks are likely to be speculative and most suited to sensitivity
      analyses.</para>

        <para>In order to illustrate the application of some of the procedures
        described in the previous sections, flood frequency curves are derived
        for a hypothetical 439 km2 catchment located in south-eastern
        Australia. It is assumed that a reservoir is located at the outlet of
        the catchment, and a streamflow recording gauge is located just
        upstream of the reservoir.</para>

        <para>Flood frequency curves are derived for both inflows to the
        reservoir, as well as for reservoir outflows. As the volume of the
        reservoir is large compared to the volume of runoff, and it is likely
        that the reservoir is drawn down below full supply level, the
        derivation of the outflow frequency curve requires consideration of
        the joint probabilities of both inflows and storage volume. A
        tributary enters the mainstream just below the reservoir, and
        estimates of concurrent tributary flows are required for a range of
        AEPs in order to help determine the component of incremental damages
        that could be attributed to dam failure.</para>

        <para>To check that the derived rainfall frequency curves are well
        behaved, it is worth plotting the results on normal probability paper.
        Rainfall may be displayed on either arithmetic or logarithmic scales,
        and if a suitable probability scale is not available then
        probabilities can be expressed as standard normal variate (ie the
        “<emphasis role="italic">z score</emphasis>”, the inverse of the
        standard normal cumulative distribution) and then plotted on an
        arithmetic axis. The <emphasis role="italic">z scores</emphasis> for
        the rarer AEPs are shown in the 2nd column of <xref
        linkend="b8_t_rq6co"/>. The frequency plot of the derived rainfall
        frequency curves are shown in <xref linkend="b8_f_mvymz"/>.
        Alternatively, the results could be plotted on log-log scales: while
        this would not as clearly illustrate the behaviour of extremes, it
        would be sufficient to check for inconsistencies.</para>

        <para>The results presented in <xref linkend="b8_t_rq6co"/> only
        relate to the standard durations for which rainfall estimates are
        directly available. It is sometimes desirable to derive frequency
        curves for non-standard durations, and this can be done for Very Rare
        to Extreme events by interpolating in the logarithmic domain between
        rainfall depth and duration for each required AEP.</para>

        <para>To illustrate the derivation of a 36 hour rainfall frequency
        curve, the rainfall depth for an event with an AEP of 1 in 1000 is
        calculated from logarithmic interpolation as:</para>

        then obtained from the interpolation procedure as described in the
        preceding section. The resulting 36 hour rainfall frequency curve is
        shown as a dashed line in <xref linkend="b8_f_mvymz"/>.</para>

      <title>Derivation of Flood Frequency Curve</title>

      <para>The rainfall frequency curves obtained in the preceding section
      can be used to derive a set of flood frequency curves. It is assumed
      that the routing parameters of the flood event model have been
      calibrated to historic flood events, and that the design losses have
      been adopted after reconciliation with flood frequency curves, as
      illustrated in <xref linkend="b8_s_3o5gi"/>. To illustrate the points
      below, the event model is run within a variable Monte Carlo framework,
      as shown in <xref linkend="b8_f_el271"/>(a). Temporal patterns are
      selected randomly from a fixed set of ensemble patterns (or from a
      conditional set based on season, if relevant), and seasonality and
      losses are sampled from non-parametric distributions, as described in
      <xref linkend="book4"/>. Seasonality is most easily accommodated by
      sampling from a distribution of the relative likelihood that the annual
      maximum event occurs in the different seasons, and this is expected to
      vary with AEP (eg in southern Australia it is more likely that the
      annual maximum occurs in winter for frequent events and in summer for
      more extreme events). Once the season has been selected, then stochastic
      values of losses (and reservoir drawdown, if relevant) are then sampled
      from their corresponding seasonal distributions. Inputs not
      stochastically sampled are fixed using representative values from the
      central tendency of their distribution. To minimise the number of
      simulations, a stratified sampling scheme is used in which the rainfall
      probability domain is divided into 20 intervals, and the expected
      probabilities of selected flood magnitudes are derived using the Total
      Probability Theorem (as described in <xref linkend="book4"/>).</para>

      <para><xref linkend="b8_f_el271"/> (b) illustrates the impact of
      successively introducing variability into the flood estimates. The black
      curve represents the frequency curve obtained using a simple design
      event approach in which all inputs (except for rainfall) are held at
      fixed values. The curve represents the envelope of all durations
      trialled. When losses are allowed to vary stochastically with season, it
      is seen from the green curve in <xref linkend="b8_f_el271"/>(b) that the
      flood peaks beyond an annual exceedance probability of 1 in 50 are
      lower; this result arises as the seasonal distribution of losses is
      slightly out of phase with that of rainfalls. Next, when an ensemble of
      temporal patterns is stochastically sampled, it is seen (blue curve)
      that the flood peaks are higher than if a fixed temporal distribution of
      rainfall is adopted. This reflects the highly non-linear runoff response
      to variability in temporal patterns. When all the inputs are allowed to
      vary stochastically it is seen (red curve) that the final result is
      slightly higher than if deterministic assumptions were adopted.</para>

      <para>It should be stressed that the results shown in <xref
      linkend="b8_f_el271"/>(b) simply illustrate the manner in which the
      probability-neutral assumptions of flood producing factors can be
      examined and combined. The magnitudes of differences between
      deterministic and joint-probability approaches are very site-specific,
      and depend largely on the sensitivity of the system to the dominant
      hydrometeorological inputs.</para>

      <title>Joint Probability Analysis of Initial Reservoir Level</title>

      <para>The examples provided here illustrate analytic and numeric schemes
      to derive a frequency curve of outflows from a reservoir under
      conditions of variable drawdown. It is assumed that the following
      information has been derived for the reservoir:</para>

      <para>(i) inflow frequency curve;</para>

      <para>(ii) the relationship between inflows and outflows, for different
      initial reservoir levels; and,</para>

      <para>(iii) the frequency distribution of storage volume.</para>

      <para>The analytical approach is based on the method developed by
      Laurenson (1974), and the numerical approach is based on Monte Carlo
      simulation.</para>

      <section xml:id="b8_s_1fcv2">
        <title>System characteristics</title>

        <para>The inflow curve of interest is that which yields the maximum
        outflow peak from the reservoir. In many cases the critical duration
        of interest varies with reservoir drawdown and AEP, and thus it may be
        necessary to undertake the analysis for several different durations
        and to construct an outflow frequency curve that envelopes the
        results. In most design situations, however, it is sufficient to
        select the duration that is most relevant to the design objective
        (say, the determination of the AEP of the overtopping flood) at a
        typical drawdown. If a single duration is adopted it is recommended
        that a sensitivity analysis be undertaken to determine the impact of
        rainfall duration on the results.</para>

        <para>For this example, the inflow frequency curve is that derived in
        the preceding section based on the stochastic sampling of seasonal
        losses and temporal patterns (red curve, <xref
        linkend="b8_f_el271"/>). The relationship between inflows, outflows,
        and initial reservoir level (I-O-S relationship) is shown in <xref
        linkend="b8_f_p0wvf"/>. The frequency distribution of storage volume
        is assumed to have been derived from the simulation results of
        long-term reservoir behaviour, and is shown in <xref

        <para>To apply the technique, the frequency distribution of inflows is
        divided into 8 class intervals, as indicated in the top row of <xref
        linkend="b8_t_cfdhv"/>. In practice a larger number of intervals would
        be preferred, but a small number has been adopted in this example for
        clarity. The probabilities of occurrence within each class interval
        are provided in the second row of <xref linkend="b8_t_cfdhv"/>; these
        are calculated simply as the difference between the exceedance
        probabilities corresponding to the class intervals.</para>

        <para>The whole range of peak outflows is divided into 20 class
        intervals, as indicated in the first column of <xref
        linkend="b8_t_cfdhv"/>. The elements of the table are then evaluated
        for each inflow class interval. The numerical values represent the
        conditional probability (in percentage points) for which an inflow
        peak in the given class interval produces an outflow peak falling in
        the selected outflow class interval. The sum of the values in each
        inflow class interval (i.e. the sum of each column) is 100. It is
        worth noting that the values provided in <xref linkend="b8_t_cfdhv"/>
        have been computed using specialist software; the numerical accuracy
        used in the calculations are greater than that which could be achieved
        using graphical techniques, but he procedural steps are
        identical.</para>

        <para>The derivation of a particular element is described as follows.
        Consider the inflow class interval of 2200
        m<superscript>3</superscript>/s to 3000
        m<superscript>3</superscript>/s and represent it by its mid-point of
        2600 m<superscript>3</superscript>/s. Consider the outflow class
        interval 1500 m<superscript>3</superscript>/s to 1690
        m<superscript>3</superscript>/s. From <xref linkend="b8_f_p0wvf"/>,
        the initial storage volume which produce peak outflows of 1500
        m<superscript>3</superscript>/s to 1690
        m<superscript>3</superscript>/s from a peak inflow of 2600
        m<superscript>3</superscript>/s are respectively 89.5% and 92.5% of
        full storage. From <xref linkend="b8_f_5gmii"/> the probabilities that
        the actual storage volume will be greater than the above are
        respectively 29.5% and 37.4%, so the probability that the initial
        volume will be between 89.5% and 92.5% of full storage volume is
        (37.4-29.5=) 7.9%. Thus the probability that a peak inflow between
        2200 m<superscript>3</superscript>/s to 3000
        m<superscript>3</superscript>/s would lead to an outflow between 1500
        m<superscript>3</superscript>/s to 1690
        m<superscript>3</superscript>/s is 7.9%. This value is inserted in the
        appropriate position in the table and other values are computed in a
        similar manner.</para>

        <para>The distribution of peak outflows is evaluated by multiplying
        each element of the table by the corresponding probability of
        occurrence of the inflow interval, and the resulting products are
        summed horizontally (and divided by 100) to give the values in the
        second last column of <xref linkend="b8_t_cfdhv"/>. For example, the
        outflow element corresponding to the outflow range of 1500
        m<superscript>3</superscript>/s to 1690
        m<superscript>3</superscript>/s is obtained from the following
        calculation:</para>

        <para>Finally, the values are added for all outflow intervals which
        exceed the outflow magnitude of interest to give the probabilities of
        exceedance, as listed in the last column. For this example, the AEP of
        Q=1500 m<superscript>3</superscript>/s is found to be 0.000757% or
        about 1 in 130 000.</para>

        <para>The calculated outflow points from <xref linkend="b8_t_cfdhv"/>
        are plotted and a curve fitted to define the frequency distribution of
        peak outflows, as shown in <xref linkend="b8_f_lz3cw"/>. Note that if
        a sufficient number of intervals are used to discretise the inflow and
        outflow frequency curves then it is probably not necessary to fit a
        curve as the points generally follow a smooth curve in the log-Normal
        probability domain.</para>

        <para>For comparison purposes, outflows are also derived for an
        initial storage volume fixed at the median level of drawdown, which is
        81.3% of the full supply storage (<xref linkend="b8_f_lz3cw"/>). The
        corresponding outflow curve is plotted in <xref
        linkend="b8_f_p0wvf"/>, and it is seen that this simplistic approach
        yields an outflow frequency curve that is significantly lower than
        that obtained using the more accurate joint probability
        approach.</para>

        <title>Monte Carlo Solution</title>

        <para>A Monte Carlo scheme can be easily extended to include the
        consideration of joint probabilities in reservoir drawdown. A
        framework suited to this is shown in <xref linkend="b8_f_ji9uy"/>.
        This framework is in essence identical to the approach used to derive
        the frequency curves shown in <xref linkend="b8_f_el271"/>, the only
        additional step is the (stochastic) sampling of initial reservoir
        level and subsequent (deterministic) routing of the inflow hydrograph
        through the storage. The initial reservoir level is best sampled in a
        non-parametric fashion from the cumulative distribution of drawdown
        (eg the distribution as shown in <xref linkend="b8_f_5gmii"/>) using
        the approach as described in <?oxy_custom_start type="oxy_content_highlight" color="255,255,0"?>Book
        4 Section 3.X<?oxy_custom_end ?>.</para>

        <para>If the distribution of initial reservoir levels is found to vary
        with event severity (as illustrated by the insert in <xref
        linkend="b8_f_u0vng"/>) then the same framework as shown in <xref
        linkend="b8_f_ji9uy"/> can still be used, the only difference being
        that a different drawdown distribution is selected depending on the
        magnitude of the inflow flood (or causative rainfall). The drawdown
        distribution selected can also vary with season to account for marked
        differences in seasonal water levels, and again the framework as shown
        in <xref linkend="b8_f_ji9uy"/> is directly applicable if
        distributions are selected according to season.</para>

      <para>For this example it is assumed that it is required to derive the
      concurrent tributary inflows originating from a 60 km2 catchment located
      just downstream of the reservoir. A township is located below the

        domain (columns 5 and 7), and the AEPs are linearised by calculating
        the corresponding standard normal variates (column 3). The latter can
        be obtained from normal probability tables, or else using the in-built
        functions available in spreadsheet software (note that the
        standardised normal variate obtained using some spreadsheet software
        may be incorrect at very low probabilities and correct values should
        be checked against published information e.g. Abramowitz and Stegun,
        1964, 1974).</para>

        <para>The parameters of the log-Normal distribution can then most
        easily be calculated by simply fitting a linear regression line
        through the transformed data (i.e. columns 3 and 5, and columns 3 and
        7). The intercept of the fitted line is equivalent to the mean of the
        distribution (as the standardised variate of the mean of a log-Normal
        distribution is zero), and the slope is equivalent to the standard
        deviation. The fitted parameters are listed below columns 5 and 7, and
        may be obtained either graphically, or by using standard spreadsheet
        functions. The design flood estimates and the fitted log-Normal
        distributions are shown in <xref linkend="b8_f_9yndi"/>. The
        log-Normal estimate (<emphasis role="italic">x</emphasis>) may be
