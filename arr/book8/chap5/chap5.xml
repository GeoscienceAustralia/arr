      with two dimensional (2D) hydraulic models. Discussion on the general catchment modelling
      concepts and the application of hydrograph and catchment models to the estimation of design
      floods is provided in <xref linkend="book4"/>, <xref linkend="book5"/> and <xref

    <para>The following discussion is focussed on the application of event-based

      models to estimate Very Rare to Extreme floods, i.e. those design situations in which models
      are used to estimate floods well beyond the range for which they can be calibrated or their
      performance tested against observed floods.
      <?oxy_insert_start author="retallick" timestamp="20160615T215620+1000"?>The principal purpose
      of these flood estimates is to support risk-based or standards-based design decisions. In some
      situations, such as floodplain management, extreme floods are estimated to provide a notional
      upper bound of the flood extent or as a performance check, and it is likely that the more
      rigorous considerations provided in this book are not
      justified.<?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_insert_start author="retallick" timestamp="20160615T215550+1000" type="split"?></para>

    <para>Guidance on the use of rain-on-grid approaches for estimation of Very Rare to Extreme

      have not been well researched or validated at this point in time and their use to simulate
      overland flow routing raises a number of difficulties which are likely to be exacerbated under
      extreme event conditions; secondly, such models are generally focussed on applications in
      floodplain management where the design risks of interest are at the lower range of events
      relevant to the guidance presented in this Book. However, the use of hydraulic models to
      simulate extreme floods does have some theoretical merit, and it is hoped that with further
      research guidelines can be developed that better integrate the benefits of these two
      approaches.</para>
    <?oxy_insert_end?>
    <para>For event-based models, the quality of the modelled flood hydrographs depends on three
      components of the modelling process: (i) the basic model capabilities and constraints, (ii)
      the quality of the catchment representation in the model, and (iii) the appropriateness of the
      selected parameter values in the flood range of interest. General recommendations for these
      three components in the context of estimating Very Rare to Extreme floods are provided
      separately in <xref linkend="b8_s_zvvef"/> to <xref linkend="b8_s_fxgci"/>, but it should be
      recognised that the components are closely linked. The theoretical advantages of a more
      flexible model that allows a more accurate representation of the important catchment features
      can only be realised if suitable data or design information exists to identify appropriate
      model parameter values.</para>

      <para>The functionalities of a hydrograph modelling package for estimating Very Rare to
        Extreme floods can be divided into basic and enhanced modelling capabilities. The basic
        capabilities indicated in <xref linkend="b8_s_jxz2e"
        /><?oxy_delete author="retallick" timestamp="20160605T183130+1000" content=" below"?> are
        regarded as essential for a modelling package that will allow satisfactory reproduction of
        runoff response characteristics over a range of catchments with different features for use
        in final design applications. Small catchments and catchments with reasonably uniform
        characteristics are less demanding in their basic model requirements. The enhanced model
        capabilities discussed in <xref linkend="b8_s_f8tz9"/> represent desirable model extensions
        required for applications in situations where the complexity of the catchment or the
        importance of the results warrants more detailed modelling. The enhanced models form a
        sounder basis for extrapolation to extreme events. The importance of these modelling
        capabilities is somewhat dependent upon catchment size, and judgement is required to
        determine the extent to which the following issues need to be considered.</para>

        <para>Significant variation of routing characteristics over the catchment, particularly in
          larger catchments, will require at least a semi-distributed representation of routing
          elements in the catchment (see <xref linkend="book5"/>). The model should have the ability
          to reflect changes in the routing response of specific elements resulting from
          modification of catchment, channel, or storage components.</para>
        <para>While there is evidence of non-linear routing response over the range of observed
          floods in most natural catchments, it is unclear to what extent this effect persists to
          the range of Very Rare to Extreme floods. In this range of flood magnitudes the routing
          response depends on how the efficiency of flow and the available flood storage change with
          increasing flood magnitude (or reducing flood frequency). The recommended procedures in
            <xref linkend="b8_s_wh2h5"/> are based on this assumption. The degree of non-linearity
          of catchment behaviour and its effects are discussed by <citation>b8_c_r59+1</citation>,

        <para>Flood estimates are often required at different points of interest within a catchment.
          The model should thus adequately represent the progressive routing effects through the
          catchment, i.e. it should be internally consistent to allow matching of observed
          hydrographs at the catchment outlet and at required internal points. It should be noted
          that some of the simple hydrograph models in current use only provide an adequate
          representation of internal flows for locations near the catchment outlet. For other
          internal locations it may be necessary to increase the degree of catchment sub-division
          (and re-calibrate the model) to conform with the recommendations for the minimum number of
          upstream sub-areas (<xref linkend="book5"/>).</para>

      <title>General Considerations</title>
      <para>Most hydrograph models are highly conceptual in nature; in setting up a model
        representation of the catchment, the modeller should therefore try to define conceptual
        model elements that match the routing response of the main components of the real catchment,
        without necessarily attempting to exactly match all physical catchment features (e.g.
        individual drainage lines, drainage divides) in detail. How this can best be achieved will
        depend on the specific features of the selected model. However, the most important factor
        determining the quality of the modelling results is the modeller’s understanding of the

          on the formation and propagation of extreme floods is currently not well researched.
          Generally, a rather arbitrary allowance must be made for these effects. Construction of a
          reservoir may inundate appreciable lengths of streams in the catchment and can lead to
          large decreases in travel time and increases in flood peaks, despite the attenuation
          resulting from the routing effect of the reservoir. This effect is discussed and examples
          are given by <citation>b8_c_r78+1</citation>, <citation>b8_c_r6+1</citation> and
            <citation>b8_c_r77+1</citation>. The last two references give examples where the inflow
          flood peak is increased by 85% by the construction of a dam. It is therefore important to
          consider this effect when using a model to derive design floods for a dam if it has been
          calibrated to pre-dam conditions.</para>

      <para>The provisions of the 1987 edition of ARR addressed the question of hydrograph model
        parameter selection for Large to Extreme events, based on the research results and
        experience available at that time <citation>b8_c_r59</citation>. There has been limited
        research since then to resolve the issue of the appropriate degree of model non-linearity
        for the estimation of Extreme flood events. Given the lack of strong research evidence,
        specific design recommendations for this range of events must be based on a consensus
        approach. The following considerations and recommendations are based on the broad range of
        views expressed by different groups of practitioners and current practice in
        Australia.</para>
      <para>The key factor to be considered when selecting parameters for modelling Very Rare to
        Extreme events is that the parameters found from calibration to a relatively narrow range of
        observed flood events cannot be assumed to apply to the range of more extreme events. As the
        magnitude of the event to be modelled increases significantly beyond the range of the
        largest observed events, the parameter selection process has to be guided more strongly by
        physical/hydraulic consideration of how the response of the catchment is expected to change
        when exposed to more extreme rainfall events. This will depend on the physical
        characteristics of hillslopes and

        <title>Calibration to the Largest Observed Flood Events</title>
        <para>The simplified conceptual representation of catchment response in the commonly used
          flood hydrograph models means that these models rely heavily on appropriately calibrated
          parameter values. While calibration of a model provides valuable information on the flood
          response of a catchment within the range of observations, caution is needed when applying
          the model to estimate design floods of much larger magnitude. Extrapolation of model
          parameter values beyond the range of calibration events will introduce considerable
          uncertainty into flood estimates.</para>
        <para>The model should thus be calibrated to events over a range of flood magnitudes up to
          the largest observed event, and the results analysed for the presence of any trends. If
          appropriate data are not available at the site of interest, consideration should be given
          to transferring parameters from a calibrated model of a nearby catchment with similar
          characteristics, with appropriate adjustments for differences in catchment size and
          characteristics.</para>
        <para>The examination of log-log plots of storage versus discharge for particular routing
          elements may be helpful in the assessment of calibration results and in identifying
          parameter variation with flood magnitude. In assessing the calibration results, it should
          be borne in mind that the calibrated parameter values for individual events reflect not
          only the catchment response to actual rainfall, but also any errors in the estimated
          catchment rainfall, in the rating curve used to establish the observed flood hydrograph,
          and in the adopted baseflow separation procedure. The first two types of errors tend to

          of the floods from which the regional relationship is derived as a guide to the likely
          conservatism of the estimate.</para>

    <title>Model Parameterisation for Urban Catchments</title>
    <para>Floods in urban catchments are the product of more complex interactions of
      hydrometeorological, hydrologic and hydraulic factors than in rural catchments. Severe floods
      can result from short duration intense rainfall over relatively small areas. The hydrologic
      response to heavy rainfalls is affected by changes to the natural runoff characteristics by
      reducing infiltration and increasing impervious surface areas. The drainage characteristics
      are changed by provision of more efficient flow paths in storm drain systems and channelised
      sections of streams. The hydraulic characteristics of drainage systems are also made more
      complex by the presence of bridges, culverts, floodways and detention basins.</para>
    <para>The degree of complexity required when modelling an urban system is largely dictated by
      the design context. If the main focus is on sizing trunk drainage capacities then it may be
      sufficient to use non-linear storage routing models, where appropriate attention is given to
      characterising the shorter relative delay times associated with urbanisation of the natural
      drainage paths. Many hydraulic controls that influence flood response in urban catchments
      become drowned out under extreme conditions, and the complexities required to model the
      performance of these systems under Very Frequent to Rare conditions may not be required for
      more extreme events.</para>
    <para>In complex systems it may not be possible to predict the changing nature of flow paths
      with event magnitude, or adequately characterise the influence of major floodplain features.
      In such cases it would be expected that flood behaviour is best assessed using hydraulic
      models, as described in <xref linkend="book6"/> and <xref linkend="book7"/>. However, while
      the use of such models better resolves the influence of hydraulic controls, they introduce
      additional complexity associated with the need to interface with the hydrologic models used to
      derive input hydrographs. The need for such an interface might be avoided by inputting
      rainfall directly onto the hydraulic model grid, but this is only possible for catchments
      where the model covers the whole contributing area. While this potentially provides a more
      realistic representation of catchment controls, the approach is not well validated at this
      point in time and is subject to additional uncertainties, as discussed in <xref
        linkend="book7"/>.</para>
    <para>The joint use of hydrologic and hydraulic routing models involves some explicit trade-offs
      in modelling complexity. On one hand hydrologic models are easily run within a joint<?oxy_insert_start author="retallick" timestamp="20160606T182112+1000"?>
      <?oxy_insert_end?><?oxy_delete author="retallick" timestamp="20160606T182111+1000" content="-"?>probability
      framework and are thus able to explicitly solve the joint probabilities involved in the
      production of flood runoff to yield unbiased estimates of flood risk. On the other, they are
      ill-suited to representing the influence of complex hydraulic controls that might arise in an
      urban environment under Extreme conditions.</para>
    <para>One means of balancing this trade-off is to use a hydraulic model to define the
      characteristics of a storage-discharge relationship. With this approach, a selection of flood
      hydrographs spanning the range of conditions of interest are input into the hydraulic model,
      and the outputs are then used to derive a relationship between storage, discharge and/or
      level, as relevant to the design problem of interest. This relationship can then be
      incorporated into a joint probability framework and then used to derive the flood
      characteristics without further need for hydraulic modelling. The advantage of the approach is
      that it combines the benefits of hydraulic modelling with stochastic simulation of flood
      processes but without impractical computational burden. The limitations of the approach is
      that it assumes that the derived storage-discharge relationship is adequate for all
      combinations of inputs, a situation that is only likely to be valid when considering one or
      two dominant mechanisms of flood loading. An example of this approach is provided by
        <citation>b8_c_r66+1</citation>, who used the hydrologic model to resolve the joint
      probabilities involved in reservoir drawdown and the concurrence of flood inflows from two
      major tributaries, and a hydraulic model to relate tributary inflows and tide levels to peak
      water levels at locations within a complex urbanised floodplain.</para>
    <para>For more complex environments it will be necessary to rely directly on a hydraulic model
      to provide a realistic representation of flow behaviour. At present it is usually impractical
      to consider running complex hydraulic models in a stochastic simulation scheme, though it is
      expected that this approach will become increasingly feasible as parallel and distributed
      computing capabilities improve and become more easily implemented. The simplest way of trading
      off the potential for bias associated with rainfall-runoff modelling and the need for accurate
      representation of hydraulic behaviour is by careful selection of deterministic hydrologic
      inputs. For example, estimates of the concurrent peak design floods may be obtained through
      ensemble or Monte Carlo approaches, and these may be used to scale representative hydrographs
      for input to deterministic simulation in a hydraulic model. At its simplest, single runs of
      hydraulic models may be undertaken for each combination of storm duration and event severity,
      but this can be extended to ensemble hydraulic runs for a more representative range of flood
      inputs. The success of either approach rests on the selection of inputs that minimise bias in
      the transformation between rainfall exceedance probability and the flood level (or outflow) of
      interest, and sensitivity analyses will assist the identification of dominant influences and
      the selection of representative scenarios to be modelled.</para>
