        <title>The Design Problem</title>
        <section xml:id="b8_s_54292">
            <title>General</title>
            <para>In order to illustrate the application of some of the procedures described in the
                previous sections, flood frequency curves are derived for a hypothetical 439
                    km<superscript>2</superscript> catchment located in south-eastern Australia. It
                is assumed that a reservoir is located at the outlet of the catchment, and a
                streamflow recording gauge is located just upstream of the reservoir.</para>
            <para>Flood frequency curves are derived for both inflows to the reservoir, as well as
                for reservoir outflows. As the volume of the reservoir is large compared to the
                volume of runoff, and it is likely that the reservoir is drawn down below full
                supply level, the derivation of the outflow frequency curve requires consideration
                of the joint probabilities of both inflows and storage volume. A tributary enters
                the mainstream just below the reservoir, and estimates of concurrent tributary flows
                are required for a range of AEPs in order to help determine the component of
                incremental damages that could be attributed to dam failure.</para>

            <title>Approach Adopted and Intent</title>
            <para>The following worked examples illustrate application of the various procedures to
                different design situations. The one hypothetical problem is used for convenience
                throughout. While somewhat didactic, the examples are not meant to provide detailed
                tutorials on the implementation of best practice, and thus some relevant experience
                will be required to fully understand the context and nature of the procedures. The
                examples illustrate application of the procedures using (largely) “real-world”
                data.</para>

            <para>It should be noted that the number of significant figures used to present the
                results of the worked examples are generally higher than can be justified. In most
                cases the accuracy of the final results is probably limited to only two significant
                figures, but greater accuracy is adopted merely to facilitate checking of the

            <para>To check that the derived rainfall frequency curves are well behaved, it is worth
                plotting the results on Normal probability paper. Rainfall may be displayed on
                either arithmetic or logarithmic scales, and if a suitable probability scale is not
                available then probabilities can be expressed as standard normal variate (i.e. the
                    “<emphasis role="italic">z score</emphasis>”, the inverse of the standard normal
                cumulative distribution) and then plotted on an arithmetic axis. The <emphasis
                    role="italic">z scores</emphasis> for the rarer AEPs are shown in the 2nd column
                of <xref linkend="b8_t_rq6co"/>. The frequency plot of the derived rainfall
                frequency curves are shown in <xref linkend="b8_f_mvymz"/>. Alternatively, the
                results could be plotted on log-log scales: while this would not as clearly
                illustrate the behaviour of extremes, it would be sufficient to check for
                inconsistencies.</para>

            <para>The results presented in <xref linkend="b8_t_rq6co"/> only relate to the standard
                durations for which rainfall estimates are directly available. It is sometimes
                desirable to derive frequency curves for non-standard durations, and this can be
                done for Very Rare to Extreme events by interpolating in the logarithmic domain

        <title>Derivation of Flood Frequency Curve</title>
        <para>The rainfall frequency curves obtained in <xref linkend="b8_s_gpl9k"/> can be used to
            derive a set of flood frequency curves. It is assumed that the routing parameters of the
            flood event model have been calibrated to historic flood events, and that the design
            losses have been adopted after reconciliation with flood frequency curves, as
            illustrated in <xref linkend="b8_s_3o5gi"/>. To illustrate the points below, the event
            model is run within a variable Monte Carlo framework, as shown in <xref
                linkend="b8_f_el271"/>(a). Temporal patterns are selected randomly from a fixed set
            of ensemble patterns (or from a conditional set based on season, if relevant), and
            seasonality and losses are sampled from non-parametric distributions, as described in
                <xref linkend="book4"/>. Seasonality is most easily accommodated by sampling from a
            distribution of the relative likelihood that the annual maximum event occurs in the
            different seasons, and this is expected to vary with AEP (e.g. in southern Australia it
            is more likely that the annual maximum occurs in winter for frequent events and in
            summer for more extreme events). Once the season has been selected, then stochastic
            values of losses (and reservoir drawdown, if relevant) are then sampled from their
            corresponding seasonal distributions. Inputs not stochastically sampled are fixed using
            representative values from the central tendency of their distribution. To minimise the
            number of simulations, a stratified sampling scheme is used in which the rainfall
            probability domain is divided into 20 intervals, and the expected probabilities of
            selected flood magnitudes are derived using the Total Probability Theorem (as described
            in <xref linkend="book4"/>).</para>
        <para><xref linkend="b8_f_el271"/> (b) illustrates the impact of successively introducing
            variability into the flood estimates. The black curve represents the frequency curve
            obtained using a simple design event approach in which all inputs (except for rainfall)
            are held at fixed values. The curve represents the envelope of all durations trialled.
            When losses are allowed to vary stochastically with season, it is seen from the light
            blue curve in <xref linkend="b8_f_el271"/>(b) that the flood peaks beyond 1 in 50 AEP
            are lower; this result arises as the seasonal distribution of losses is slightly out of
            phase with that of rainfalls. Next, when an ensemble of temporal patterns is
            stochastically sampled, it is seen (darker blue curve) that the flood peaks are higher
            than if a fixed temporal distribution of rainfall is adopted. This reflects the highly
            non-linear runoff response to variability in temporal patterns. When all the inputs are
            allowed to vary stochastically it is seen (red curve) that the final result is slightly
            higher than if deterministic assumptions were adopted.</para>
        <para>It should be stressed that the results shown in <xref linkend="b8_f_el271"/>(b) simply
            illustrate the manner in which the probability neutral assumptions of flood producing
            factors can be examined and combined. The magnitudes of differences between
            deterministic and joint probability approaches are very site-specific, and depend
            largely on the sensitivity of the system to the dominant hydrometeorological
            inputs.</para>

        <para>The examples provided here illustrate analytic and numeric schemes to derive a

            <para>The inflow curve of interest is that which yields the maximum outflow peak from
                the reservoir. In many cases the critical duration of interest varies with reservoir
                drawdown and AEP, and thus it may be necessary to undertake the analysis for several
                different durations and to construct an outflow frequency curve that envelopes the
                results. In most design situations, however, it is sufficient to select the duration
                that is most relevant to the design objective (say, the determination of the AEP of
                the overtopping flood) at a typical drawdown. If a single duration is adopted it is
                recommended that a sensitivity analysis be undertaken to determine the impact of
                rainfall duration on the results.</para>

                these are calculated simply as the difference between the exceedance probabilities
                corresponding to the class intervals.</para>
            <para>The whole range of peak outflows is divided into 20 class intervals, as indicated
                in the first column of <xref linkend="b8_t_cfdhv"/>. The elements of the table are
                then evaluated for each inflow class interval. The numerical values represent the
                conditional probability (in percentage points) for which an inflow peak in the given
                class interval produces an outflow peak falling in the selected outflow class
                interval. The sum of the values in each inflow class interval (i.e. the sum of each
                column) is 100. It is worth noting that the values provided in <xref
                    linkend="b8_t_cfdhv"/> have been computed using specialist software; the
                numerical accuracy used in the calculations are greater than that which could be
                achieved using graphical techniques,

            <para>The derivation of a particular element is described as follows. Consider the
                inflow class interval of 2200 m<superscript>3</superscript>/s to 3000
                    m<superscript>3</superscript>/s and represent it by its mid-point of 2600
                    m<superscript>3</superscript>/s. Consider the outflow class interval 1500
                    m<superscript>3</superscript>/s to 1690 m<superscript>3</superscript>/s. From
                    <xref linkend="b8_f_p0wvf"/>, the initial storage volume which produce peak
                outflows of 1500 m<superscript>3</superscript>/s to 1690
                    m<superscript>3</superscript>/s from a peak inflow of 2600
                    m<superscript>3</superscript>/s are respectively 89.5% and 92.5% of full
                storage. From <xref linkend="b8_f_5gmii"/> the probabilities that the actual storage
                volume will be greater than the above are respectively 29.5% and 37.4%, so the
                probability that the initial volume will be between 89.5% and 92.5% of full storage
                volume is (37.4-29.5)= 7.9%. Thus the probability that a peak inflow between 2200
                    m<superscript>3</superscript>/s to 3000 m<superscript>3</superscript>/s would
                lead to an outflow between 1500 m<superscript>3</superscript>/s to 1690
                    m<superscript>3</superscript>/s is 7.9%. This value is inserted in the
                appropriate position in the table and other values are computed in a similar
                manner.</para>
            <para>The distribution of peak outflows is evaluated by multiplying each element of the
                table by the corresponding probability of occurrence of the inflow interval, and the
                resulting products are summed horizontally (and divided by 100) to give the values
                in the second last column of <xref linkend="b8_t_cfdhv"/>. For example, the outflow
                element corresponding to the outflow range of 1500 m<superscript>3</superscript>/s
                to 1690 m<superscript>3</superscript>/s is obtained from the following

            <para>Finally, the values are added for all outflow intervals which exceed the outflow
                magnitude of interest to give the probabilities of exceedance, as listed in the last
                column. For this example, the AEP of Q=1500 m<superscript>3</superscript>/s is found
                to be 0.000757% or about 1 in 130 000.</para>
            <para>The calculated outflow points from <xref linkend="b8_t_cfdhv"/> are plotted and a
                curve fitted to define the frequency distribution of peak outflows, as shown in
                    <xref linkend="b8_f_lz3cw"/>. Note that if a sufficient number of intervals are
                used to discretise the inflow and outflow frequency curves then it is probably not
                necessary to fit a curve as the points generally follow a smooth curve in the
                log-Normal probability domain.</para>
            <para>For comparison purposes, outflows are also derived for an initial storage volume
                fixed at the median level of drawdown, which is 81.3% of the full supply storage
                    (<xref linkend="b8_f_lz3cw"/>). The corresponding outflow curve is plotted in
                    <xref linkend="b8_f_p0wvf"/>, and it is seen that this simplistic approach
                yields an outflow frequency curve that is significantly lower than that obtained

            <para>A Monte Carlo scheme can be easily extended to include the consideration of joint

                    linkend="b8_f_ji9uy"/>. This framework is in essence identical to the approach
                used to derive the frequency curves shown in <xref linkend="b8_f_el271"/>, the only
                additional step is the (stochastic) sampling of initial reservoir level and
                subsequent (deterministic) routing of the inflow hydrograph through the storage. The
                initial reservoir level is best sampled in a non-parametric fashion from the
                cumulative distribution of drawdown (e.g. the distribution as shown in <xref

                difference being that a different drawdown distribution is selected depending on the
                magnitude of the inflow flood (or causative rainfall). The drawdown distribution
                selected can also vary with season to account for marked differences in seasonal
                water levels, and again the framework as shown in <xref linkend="b8_f_ji9uy"/> is
