    <para>This book first provides a general introduction to urban drainage
    systems and the philosophy adopted in Australian Rainfall and Runoff. It
    then discusses urban drainage approaches, changes to the natural
    hydrologic cycle resulting from urbanisation and how these changes impact
    on design flood estimation in urban environments , and use of storage
    facilities from on-site storage to detention (retention) basins to large
    flood mitigation dams. An important aspect of this discussion relates to
    limitations of the Rational method and the changes in approach necessary
    for consideration of volume-based problems rather than peak flow based
    problems. Also included in this book is guidance on designing for the
    safety of people and vehicles. The people safety information presented
    includes a discussion of the importance of the demographics in assessing
    safety.</para>
