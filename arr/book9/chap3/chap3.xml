      new, they have wide adoption and support in legislation and policies for water management
      throughout Australia. Similar changes in approach to urban stormwater management in other

      Consequently, the approach to urban stormwater management includes water supply and is based
      on retention and conveyance of stormwater runoff to meet multi-purpose design objectives that
      enhance livability of urban areas, mitigate nuisance, and avoid damage to property and loss of
      life.<?oxy_insert_end?></para>

    <para>Australia has experienced considerable improvement in urban water management since the
      1800s, supported and underpinned by publications such as ARR <citation>b9_c3_r21</citation>.
      Stormwater drainage in Australia evolved from combined sewers that rapidly discharged the
      accumulated rubbish, sewage, sullage and stormwater from streets to waterways
        <citation>b9_c3_r32,b9_c3_r17</citation>. The
      impact<?oxy_delete author="ward" timestamp="20160525T100748+1000" content="s"?> on waterways
      and amenity of urban settlements drove the separation of sewage and stormwater infrastructure.
      Filling of swamps and development of contributing catchments to accommodate population growth
      resulted in frequent flooding of early settlements. Drainage solutions emerged to avoid
      stagnant water, local flooding and health impacts in urban areas. Nation building works<?oxy_insert_start author="testoni" timestamp="20181003T131056+1000"?>

      green infrastructure and microclimates that reduce urban heat island effects. Urban catchments
      with impervious surfaces are substantially more efficient than conventional water supply
      catchments in translating rainfall into surface runoff. Rainwater and stormwater harvesting

      and the local property scale is the building block of cumulative rainfall runoff processes

        this is unlikely since the rainfall mechanisms that typically cause each type of flood are

      <para>The characteristics of urban form including the layout of roads, location of urban

        consequences (for example, an unintended diversion of flows into an adjoining catchment
        because of blockage or extreme events). </para>

    <para>Tradeable permits or offset schemes are also known as market mechanisms and are
      established methods within the pollution control industry, in water markets and for management

      contributions paid by a landholder for provision of pollution control works at another
      location, construction of an alternative mitigation scheme instead of a conventional solution
      in the landholders development site, or the sale of a water licence from a landholder to
      another landholder at another location. </para>

      water quality to deteriorate at different times and rates in some parts of a catchment.
      Therefore designing a tradeable permit or offset scheme needs to take spatial, temporal and
      environmental equivalence effects into account. </para>

      operation. It is also emphasized that achieving equivalence in stream biodiversity and
      ecological function is extremely difficult. </para>
    <para><citation>b9_c3_r35+1</citation> argue that stormwater off-sets should not result in
      avoided management of stormwater runoff. They emphasize the substantial challenge of
      adequately considering spatial, temporal and environmental influences of off-sets, and the
      importance of quantifying the spatial extent of stormwater impacts from the development in
      question. It is highlighted that unmitigated stormwater runoff from relatively small
      proportions of urban areas may propagate severe impacts a long way downstream which can render
      the practice of offsetting within a single catchment a difficult undertaking.</para>
