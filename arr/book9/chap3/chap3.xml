    <title>The Journey from 1987 to 2015</title>
    <para>Australia has experienced considerable improvement in urban water management since the
      1800s, supported and underpinned by publications such as ARR <citation>b9_c3_r21</citation>.
      Stormwater drainage in Australia evolved from combined sewers that rapidly discharged the
      accumulated rubbish, sewage, sullage and stormwater from streets to waterways
        <citation>b9_c3_r32,b9_c3_r17</citation>. The
      impact<?oxy_delete author="ward" timestamp="20160525T100748+1000" content="s"?> on waterways
      and amenity of urban settlements drove the separation of sewage and stormwater infrastructure.
      Filling of swamps and development of contributing catchments to accommodate population growth
      resulted in frequent flooding of early settlements. Drainage solutions emerged to avoid
      stagnant water, local flooding and health impacts in urban areas. Nation building works
      programs during economic depressions (for example in 1890 and 1920) and following wars
      provided large scale drainage infrastructure throughout Australia.</para>

    <para>Current approaches to stormwater management include separate design processes and

      Integrated design includes solutions that meet multiple objectives, includes the catchment
      boundaries of each element and aims to avoid redundant infrastructure. Realisation of these
      benefits is dependent on integrated design approaches that account for changes in the timing
      and volumes of stormwater runoff, and respond to multiple objectives. Analysis of the economic
      benefits of integrated designs and drainage networks should be evaluated across an entire
      system from the perspective of whole of society. The methods and objectives for estimating
      urban stormwater runoff and the design of pipe drainage networks from 1987 do not include
      these additional considerations. </para>

      <para>The management of hazards created by fluvial flooding differs from overland flooding as

        emergency systems become more important where development has already occurred within parts
        of the floodplain subject to fluvial flooding. Catchments that generate fluvial flooding are
        often large and the lag between rainfall and runoff can be sufficient which increases the

        this is unlikely since the rainfall mechanisms that typically cause each type of flood are
        different. It is more likely that overland and fluvial flooding will occur at different
        times and possibly not during a single rainfall event. This complex behaviour can confuse
        attempts to communicate flood risks and implement management strategies. Confusion also
        arises when insurance claims are made for loss and damage because the decision to pay a
        claim sometimes relies upon whether the flooding was overland or fluvial in nature.

      downstream flood levels for a particular probability of storm events.</para>
    <para>A more thorough approach also includes management of peak discharges for a full spectrum

      acceleration in the timing to peak flows due to urbanisation may not be acceptable for

      these issues are challenging, requiring complex calculations. Older calculation methods and

    <para>The spatial distribution and configuration of volume management facilities need careful

          This employs small facilities, widely distributed across the catchment, many of which will

      there has been disproportionate focus on mitigating nuisance in the minor system at the
      expense of a proper analysis of the major system. Replacement of the minor or major drainage
      approach with the relativity of mitigating nuisance or disaster may be appropriate. Allowing

      other quality guidelines so that urban stormwater management is an integrated part of the

    <para>This edition of ARR highlights the need to consider integrated approaches for future urban
      water management. This means that historical approaches of separate analyses of water
      quantity, water quality, drinking water and wastewater systems are no longer the best
      approach. Integrated systems have the capacity to produce solutions that respond to multiple
      objectives including economic, social and environmental criteria.</para>
    <para>ARR promotes methods that bring these elements together in a combined analysis approach.
      It is expected that this will require strong leadership from the water industry and a
      recognition of the need to collaborate across science, engineering, planning and sociological
      sectors in order to maximise the opportunities for implementing integrated solutions.</para>
