    <title>Major and Minor</title>

    <para>Steve Roso</para>

    <para>over 30 year history with major minor approach this approach has had
    different focus in different jurisdictions and history has shown </para>

    <para>-if you get major correct problems minor can be resolved. </para>

    <para>- if you get the minor right but major wrong then problem is often
    unresolvable. </para>

    <para>- this is apparent in brown field sites where one off opportunities
    to resolve problem</para>

    <para>modelling has often focused on either minor (pipes) or major
    (overland) but not both.</para>

    <para>philosophical discussion - with practical advice</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>if you get the major correct, problems with the minor can be
        more easily resolved</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>if you get the minor and not the major it is harder to go back
        and fix the major</para>
      </listitem>

    <para>no specific model name</para>

    <para>green field and brown field considerations</para>

    <para>range of frequencies need to be considered</para>

    <para>system performance with minor point performance</para>

    <para>where major and minor has worked and not worked. the balance between
    the frequencies</para>

    <para>not ignore floods above q100</para>

    <title>Pluvial and Fluvial</title>

    <para>Steve Roso</para>

    <para>overland vs riverine</para>

    <para>make sure overland is not ignored</para>

    <para>interface has perplexed everyone ((community insurers and
    professionals)</para>

    <para>the interface changes with event magnitude</para>

    <para>accuracy of overland flow modelling is less than riverine
    modelling.</para>

    <para>application of freeboard on overland flows</para>

    <para>just as important in overland systems to maintain the flow
    paths</para>

    <para>2 - 3 pages</para>

    <title>Volume Problem</title>

    <para>Steve Roso</para>

    <para>historically looked at peak flows, now we need to look at levels or
    volumes</para>

    <para>our urban drainage solutions have shifted from conveyance solution
    to a storage solution. methods have not kept up.</para>

    <para>practitioners need to use methods that are compatible with the
    solutions they are proposing.</para>

    <para>this problem is exacerbated by the additional volumes created by
    urbanisation</para>

    <para>the shift from conveyance solutions (pipes and channels) to storage
    solutions which older methods aren't equipped for.</para>

    <para>2 - 3 pages</para>
