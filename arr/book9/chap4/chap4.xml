  <title>Modelling Approaches</title>

  <para/>

  <section>
    <title>Outline</title>

    <para>builds and refers to the first three chapters</para>

    <para>why different to rural</para>

    <para>peak vs full hydrograph</para>

    <para>advantages and disadvanatages of each</para>

    <para>guidance on application (which one to use)</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Simple modelling approaches</title>

    <para>disclaimer that simple methods are only appropriate for small non
    critical areas not dealing with storage</para>

    <section>
      <title>urban rational</title>

      <para>limits on application</para>

      <para>no data</para>

      <para>you can have rational method parameters for volume and peak flow
      as well as runoff coeff for very frequent flows</para>

      <para>on our wishlist, need more data</para>

  <section>
    <title>Complex Models</title>

    <para>take into account the catchment topology and produce full
    hydrographs</para>

    <para>full hydrograph methods</para>

    <para>refer back to books 4 5 6 and 7</para>

    <para>definition of a complex model and examples (bit of repetition of
    book 4)</para>

    <para>give a general description and capability of softwares (rorb, rafts,
    wbnm, rainfall on grid, drains)</para>

    <para>these complex models are different because they have been designed
    for different problems and some have been applied in the urban sector
    (originally used for rural). Just because it has a feature doesn't mean it
    is suitable for urban use</para>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Application</title>

    <para>will be repetition of book 7 with a focus on where it's different
    from rural catchments</para>

    <section>
      <title>Impervious Areas</title>

      <para>warning, can't model impervious separate from pervious</para>

      <para>historical we have modelled them separately when they actually
      interact.</para>

      <para>general discussion of dca and idca and effective impervious - and
      refer to losses chapter</para>

      <para>historically some organisation have incorrectly used total
      impervious area where now say use the methods above</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Pervious Areas</title>

      <para>general discussion of loss models (ref to book 5)</para>

      <para>quick discussion on how urban pervious areas are different to
      rural but generally treated in a similar manner</para>

      <para>couple of paragraphs</para>

      <para>what is different from rural parameters (refer to book 7)</para>

      <para>more complex and generally made more assumptions</para>

      <para>if pipe and overland aren't modelled separately</para>

      <para>complexity and scale, shift uncertainty</para>

      <para>lumped vs distributed systems</para>

    <section>
      <title>Calibration and Validation of Urban Models</title>

      <para>refer to book 7 and what is different in the data for calibration.
      this is why urban models are hard to calibrated, more complex models,
      data is poorer, more parameter interaction</para>

      <para>less data (very little flow data), some height data of different
      qualities, height data is very influences by local factors, for example:
      bins, drains blocked, cars parked</para>

      <para>calibrating to height not flow introduces a further level of
      uncertainty, though you dont have a lot of choice.</para>

      <para>make the most of what you have - resident anecdotal</para>

      <para>urban models tend to be more complex with a large number of
      parameter sets which can produce the same estimate but extrapolate
      differently. this parameter interaction makes determining parameters
      difficult and often makes options perform in unexpected ways</para>

      <para>calibration adjustment can be on any number of parameters</para>

      <para>parameters are interrelated</para>

      <para>more parameters (compared to rural) = more parameter uncertainty,
      more parameter interaction</para>
