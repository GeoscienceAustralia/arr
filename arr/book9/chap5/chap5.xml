        <para>Stormwater conveyance combines hydrological and hydraulic methods to safely convey
            stormwater generated by rain falling on urban surfaces to an outlet. Analysis of
            conveyance infrastructure  typically includes the hydrology of sub-catchments that
            transfer rainfall runoff to inlet structures feeding a network of other conveyance
            infrastructure including pipes, open channels, roadways and open space. </para>
        <para>Conveyance infrastructure is one of the many tools available to the designer for urban
            stormwater management which is part of the process of managing the water cycle. For
            example a stormwater management strategy for an urban area will include a wide range of
            measures to manage stormwater runoff volumes and flow rates, for example on-site
            detention, bio-retention, rain water, stormwater harvesting and infiltration systems.
            These may alter the inflows to and the design of the stormwater conveyance network as
            shown in <xref linkend="b9_ch5_f_s4eek"/>. These volume management measures (as
            described in <xref linkend="b9_ch4"/>) can operate at different scales such as source
            and neighbourhood controls that alter inputs to conveyance networks and regional
            controls that mitigate outflows from conveyance networks. </para>
        <para>This chapter focuses on the design and analysis of stormwater conveyance
            networks.</para>

        <title>Design Philosophy and Objectives</title>
        <para>Design of urban stormwater conveyance networks has been comprehensively addressed in
            guidelines within Australia and internationally. These guidelines include aspects of the
            design of stormwater infrastructure with different levels of detail that often
            concentrate on key areas of design focus (such as urban developments or main highways)
            or on problematic areas of concern that are specific to a locality or past events. It is
            generally the responsibility of the designer to select an adequate design procedure.
            However, the objectives and attributes of stormwater conveyance networks are often
            specified by the local approval authority. These authorities may base their guidance on
            other design specifications and guidelines such as Aus-Spec, Austroads, or the Victorian
            Infrastructure Design manual.</para>
        <para>This section provides an overview of the philosophy and objectives for design of
            stormwater conveyance networks. The primary focus of this section is hydraulics and
            hydrology, and design safety requirements. Nevertheless, there are other important
            aspects that should be considered during the planning and design of conveyance networks.
            These include constructability, aesthetics, future maintenance, direct costs, long term
            economic factors, and the potential liability created by a conveyance network. The
            design should also account for the practicality of replacing conveyance infrastructure
            at the end of its design life.</para>
        <para>A key hydraulic criterion is to define a conveyance network that restricts surface
            flows to safe limits. The primary design requirement is that stormwater depths should
            not be greater than a threshold value above the top of inlet pit or invert of a road
            gutter. This prevents inlet pits filling to the brim under design conditions which
            inhibits stormwater flows from entering conveyance networks. The threshold depth is
            typically set by the relevant approval authority and is in the order of 150 mm. Approval
            authorities also typically specify maximum velocities of surface flows and minimum
            velocities of flows in conveyance infrastructure. </para>
        <para>In situations where surface flows are conveyed through public places, including
            footpaths, roads and public places, it is important to ensure that unacceptable hazards
            to people are not created (refer to <xref linkend="b9_ch8"/>). Keeping the depth and
            velocity-depth attributes of surface flow within acceptable limits will minimise these
            hazards. When the primary purpose of a pathway is for conveyance of stormwater, it will
            usually be more efficient to convey flows in a dedicated watercourse that can accept
            higher velocity and depths of flows. These types of flow paths can be designed for dual
            uses (stormwater conveyance and public access) provided that the design ensures that
            people cannot be trapped by stormwater flows. </para>
        <para>These limits are intended to ensure that stormwater conveyance networks operate at
            given levels of service without causing flooding of properties, nuisance or hazard to
            pedestrians and to traffic on streets. An approval authority typically specifies the
            design AEP of the minor and major storm events required for different land uses. Designs
            usually involve minor system capacity criteria for design of conveyance infrastructure
            and major system assumptions to ensure the urban area can safely cope with larger storm
            events as shown in <xref linkend="b9_ch5_f_sdilj"/>.</para>

        <para><xref linkend="b9_ch5_f_sdilj"/> shows that the minor system is used to define the
            performance of the conveyance networks which include overland and bypass flows on roads,
            and performance of conveyance infrastructure (such as pipes and culverts). The major
            conveyance system includes the road profile and overland flow paths, and aims to ensure
            the safety of pedestrian and vehicle traffic whilst avoiding property damage and risk to
            life. In the absence of guidance from a consent authority, the design AEP storm events
            are selected to reflect the importance of a facility or urban area and the consequences
            of failure. Some examples are:</para>

        <para>Both design and analysis processes involve modelling the operation of a conveyance
            network that is subject to critical rare storm events that produce maximum flow rates
            for the selected AEP events. The selection of critical storm events will involve finding
            storm durations or particular storm patterns within ensembles or continuous sequences of
            rainfall that create maximum outputs for a particular location. Typically, the design of
            a conveyance network is shaped and sized to cater for critical storms for selected AEP
            events. This approach recognises that:</para>

                <para>It is not practical or economically feasible to design conveyance networks to

                    large and expensive conveyance networks that would occupy a considerable land
                    space. This would impact on the optimum provision other infrastructure services,

        <title>Conveyance Networks</title>
        <para>The design or analysis process for conveyance networks requires observation of the
            real world situation; definition of the problem and objectives of the design;
            development of a conceptual model of real world behaviours; calibration using observed
            data; and predictions or design. A conceptual model of a conveyance network involves
            hydrological and hydraulic modelling including components such as inlet pits, pipes,
            open channels, roadways and storages. A general overview of the modelling and design
            process is presented in <xref linkend="b9_ch5_f_2a26n"/>.</para>

            hydraulic modelling of the conveyance network. This process usually incorporates a
            hydrological model than translates design or real rainfall patterns into design flow
            rates and volumes of stormwater arriving at inlet structures within a conveyance
            network. A hydraulic model then converts these inflows into flow characteristics
            (depths, elevations, widths, velocities, and volumes) throughout the network. The design

        <para><xref linkend="b9_ch5_f_qpbaz"/> shows different configurations of conveyance networks
            used in New South Wales and Queensland which highlights that a range of configurations
            are favoured across different jurisdictions. For example, in some Queensland
            jurisdictions, pipes are located under road centrelines and manholes at junctions in the
            conveyance network are used as collectors from inlet pits. Differences in terminology
            also occur across jurisdictions. For example,  in New South Wales  ‘kerb and gutter’ is
            used, while in Victoria and Queensland the term ‘kerb and channel’ is employed.</para>
        <para>In some cases, maintenance holes, junctions or junction boxes (pits) are provided as
            nodes linking branches in the conveyance network. Other pits that are intended to
            overflow are called surcharge pits, overflow pits, or ‘bubble up’ pits. In established
            urban areas, looped networks may occur where additional pipes are added to provide
            additional conveyance capacity which can change the behaviour of the original conveyance
            network.</para>
        <para>Conveyance infrastructure (for example: pipes, culverts, channels, and swales) are,
            mostly, constructed as straight sections with constant slope. Pipe and culvert
            conveyance infrastructure are available in standard dimensions supplied by the
            manufacturers. For example, the diameters of PVC pipes range from 90 mm to about 600 mm,
            and the diameters of reinforced concrete pipes start at 225 mm and increase to over 2
            metres. Road authorities usually specify a minimum pipe diameter of 300 mm to 375 mm
            within road reserves to improve maintenance outcomes.</para>
        <para> It is vital that conveyance networks include overland flow paths to control major
            stormwater runoff events. These overland flow paths should be within road profiles or
            through open space and pedestrian pathways. Flow paths through private property should
            be provided as a last resort and will require an easement (a legal instrument providing
            a right to drain stormwater through a property and permitting authorities to enter the
            site for maintenance). Overland flows directed through private property can create
            hazards and inhibit the development and value of the property as the required easement
            cannot be blocked or built upon.</para>
        <para>Conveyance infrastructures (pipes) are designed to limit surface flows on roads to
            avoid nuisance to pedestrians and motorists. This process incorporates the design of
            roads including profiles of high locations (most often along road centrelines) and low
            locations (most often the inverts of gutters). The trapped low points in road networks
            require the provision of sag pits which will usually inform the required network of
            conveyance infrastructure (pipes) that can be realised by ‘joining up the dots’ between
            pits as shown in <xref linkend="b9_ch5_f_hqvt5"/>.</para>

        <para><xref linkend="b9_ch5_f_sa5dh"/> indicates the location of inlet pits at the top of a
            conveyance network. The street gutters are part of the conveyance network and are
            utilised to transport stormwater towards inlet pits that are situated at intervals to
            ensure that acceptable flows are carried in road gutters. The width and depth of flows
            in gutters are limited to allow unimpeded access for pedestrians and vehicles. A maximum
            width of gutter flow of 2 m to 2.5 m with a maximum flow depth of 150 mm is generally
            acceptable. Local authorities typically provide guidance on these values. Locations of
            inlet pits to ensure adequate conveyance of stormwater may also be determined from
            percentages of stormwater runoff captured by each pit, and the depth of flow and the
            velocity-depth product of flows in the road gutter.</para>
        <para>A designer typically prefers collecting all stormwater runoff from the upper side of
            the street as shown in <xref linkend="b9_ch5_f_sa5dh"/> with an inlet pit at Point D
            which avoids the need for a conveyance branch in the street. This possibility is
            evaluated by establishing a trial location (A) where stormwater runoff from the
            corresponding catchment is calculated and the corresponding width of gutter flow is
            estimated. The width of flows will increase along the gutter length as the areas of
            contributing catchments increase. A pit must be located whenever any of the criterion
            limits (such as flow width, depth, or velocity-depth product) are reached. Note that the
            design process is about limiting surface flows.</para>
        <para>Capture of all stormwater runoff at inlet pit B reduces surface flow to zero just
            downstream of the pit, with surface flows increasing again along the gutter due to
            lateral inflows from the catchment. However, it is unlikely that on-grade pits will
            capture all stormwater runoff from catchment areas during minor storm events that create
            bypass flows downstream of the pit. This is shown at inlet pit C where the flow width
            increases and reduces due to the pit with a bypass, and some width of flow just
            downstream of the pit. The flow widths along the gutter will typically follow a
            saw-tooth pattern.</para>
        <para><xref linkend="b9_ch5_f_sa5dh"/> also highlights that an inlet pit must be located
            upstream of a tangent point at an intersection to prevent excessive surface flows at the
            kerb return. Bypass flows from this inlet pit are collected at inlet pit D. The other
            pits at the intersection are located along the path of surface overflows to collect both
            minor and major overflows. This configuration of inlet structures (pits) allows
            pedestrians to cross at street corners without being exposed to large widths of
            flows.</para>
        <para>The location of inlet pits in the conveyance network may also be driven by a need to
            provide an inlet at a significant location, such as near a school with street crossings
            or at a change in road alignment. Aspects of good design practice include location of
            inlet pits upstream of driveways and avoidance of clashes with other services. A
            conveyance network also includes additional pipe connections from private property that
            should be incorporated in the design or analysis of the conveyance network for the
            street. This may include directly connected pipes from sources such as inter-allotment
            drainage, on-site volume management systems (such as onsite detention and rain water
            tanks), or major commercial developments. The first inlet pit in the conveyance network
            for the street may be receiving considerable pipe flow from upstream private
            property.</para>
        <para>The designer needs to decide on the density of inlet pits in the conveyance network.
            This decision will typically be guided by the local authority. For example, the two
            arrangements of inlet pits at an intersection may be acceptable in two different
            scenarios as shown in <xref linkend="b9_ch5_f_64v37"/>.</para>

            the configuration of inlet pits is dependent on the magnitudes and consequences of the
            flows that may bypass the inlet pits. In a densely-developed area, where overflows or
            bypass flows may cause nuisance and damage, a greater number of inlet pits will be
            preferred. Fewer inlet pits can be used in a lower density development where surface
            flows are more easily managed and the consequences of overflows or bypass flows are
            small.</para>

        <title>Design of Conveyance Networks with Computer Models</title>
        <para>Design of urban stormwater conveyance networks has a long history in Australia. Hand
            calculations using the urban Rational Method was discussed in the 1958, 1977 and 1987
            editions of ARR as the most utilised method for estimation of stormwater inflows to
            conveyance or drainage networks. There is significant ongoing concern about the reliable
            characterisation of the parameters (such as runoff co-efficient and time of
            concentration) underpinning the Rational Method due to insufficient rainfall runoff
            observations in urban areas <citation>b9_c5_r1</citation>. </para>
        <para>A transition into the computer age heralded the design and analysis of urban
            conveyance networks using computers to operate drainage software or spreadsheet
            manipulation that often implemented the Rational Method. The sizing of conveyance
            infrastructure was based on estimates of peak flows. Increases in computing power
            allowed greater access to software that integrated hydrology and hydraulics to more
            accurately analyse or design conveyance networks using hydrograph methods. Additional
            details about urban modelling approaches are provided in <xref linkend="b9_ch6"
            />.</para>
        <para>The characteristics of contemporary urban stormwater management have evolved to be
            different to the objectives and design solutions for urban stormwater drainage or
            conveyance networks as envisaged in 1987 <citation>b9_c5_r2</citation>. Since the 19th
            century, the Rational Method and hand calculations has evolved into modern rainfall
            runoff models (refer to <xref linkend="b9_ch3"/>). The catchment area has been
            subdivided into sub-catchments. Average rainfall intensity derived from storm bursts has
            been modernised to include temporal patterns, spatial variation, relationships between
            different burst rainfall depths and durations, and the capture of partial areas effects.
            The runoff coefficient for estimation of stormwater runoff has been replaced with
            processes that account for the degree of urbanisation and spatial distribution of
            different land uses, addition of loss models to determine rainfall excess, accounting
            for pervious and directly or indirectly connected impervious surfaces, and inclusion of
            depression storages. </para>

        <para>These evolving models account for modern urban features including distributed storages
            such as rain water tanks, bio-retention and on-site detention; detention basins and the
            spatial distribution of urban features (refer to <xref linkend="b9_ch4"/>). Modern
            design criteria include analysis of the volume, timing and frequency of stormwater
            runoff to determine peak flow rates, water quality and requirements. This is done to
            mimic natural regimes of volumetric flows to protect waterway health <citation>b9_c5_r3,
                b9_c5_r4</citation>. Management of the volume of stormwater runoff and the frequency
            of runoff events from urban catchments is now seen as a key design objective to mitigate
            downstream flooding and protect the health of urban waterways. </para>
        <para>Predictions of peak stormwater flows using the Rational Method may not adequately
            represent the fundamental processes occurring within contemporary urban catchments
                <citation>b9_c5_r1</citation>. This concern is particularly relevant to modern
            stormwater management methods, such as Water Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD), that include
            cascading integrated solutions involving retention, slow drainage via vegetation,
            harvesting and reuse of stormwater and the disconnection of impervious surfaces. These
            distributed solutions within catchments alter runoff volume and timing in a variable
            manner throughout a catchment (refer to <xref linkend="b9_ch3"/>). These dynamics are
            more likely to be revealed by advanced analysis methods. Importantly, provision of
            optimum designs for urban stormwater management is dependent on testing solutions across
            the full range of urban dynamics. The limited urban data available for characterising
            the parameters underpinning the urban Rational Method for average urban conditions
            remains a challenge.</para>
        <para>The design procedure using computer models is typically implemented more easily and
            accurately than the simpler design methods. A main advantage is the ability of a
            computer model to rapidly perform design procedures once a system is set up and the
            necessary data is entered. In addition, use of computer software allows simultaneous
            analysis of both minor and major storm events to adequately size inlet structures and
            conveyance infrastructure, ensuring safe overland flow outcomes. </para>
        <para>The procedures for design of conveyance networks have evolved from simplifying
            assumptions required for hand calculations, such as assuming that pipes are flowing full
            but not under pressure. Modern methods include more calculations and checks, and can
            apply unsteady flow hydraulic simulations throughout conveyance networks. These complex
            calculations are implemented using computers. The amount of calculations is now so large
            that simple numerical checks using hand calculations are not possible. However, ‘sanity
            checks’ can (and should) be made to compare results from models using simplified
            procedures such as estimating flowrates per unit area. These simple checks will provide
            estimates that are different to the results produced by computer models, however, this
            process should assist in avoiding gross errors.</para>
        <para>Peak flowrates and hydrographs calculated by rainfall-runoff models are inputs to
            hydraulic models that determine the characteristics (elevations, depths, widths and
            velocities) of stormwater flows throughout catchments. Hydraulic modelling is based on
            physics and requires that the geometry of components of a conveyance network should be
            carefully defined. Key hydraulic concepts such as Continuity, Conservation of Mass,
            Energy, and the Bernoulli's Equation, are covered in <xref linkend="b6_ch2"/>. The
            Friction Equations including Darcy-Weisbach, the Manning and the Colebrook-White
            Equations (<xref linkend="b6_ch2"/>) are all important considerations for the hydraulic
            design of conveyance networks.</para>
        <para>A range of hydraulic models can be used to design conveyance networks. The performance
            of the models can be illustrated by Hydraulic Grade Lines (HGL) and Eenergy Grade Lines
            (EGL, also called Total Energy Line, TEL). These grade lines are described in books on
            fluid mechanics and hydraulics and are useful  for understanding flow phenomena.</para>
        <para> The design of conveyance infrastructure is highly dependent on the capacity of inlet
            structures. Inlet structures (pits) are chosen, and then surcharges from each structure
            are calculated, which determines the possible cumulative surface flows throughout
            sub-catchments. A check is made to see whether the hydraulic characteristics of
            surcharges exceed performance objectives for the network (such as safety and access
            criteria). If the performance objectives are exceeded, the size of inlet structures
            needs to be  increased using the next largest inlet structures and calculations proceed.
            During the design of inflows and associated dimensions of inlet structures, conveyance
            infrastructure (pipes) are also sized to ensure that the performance objectives are met.
            This process continues until a satisfactory level of surface flow is reached.</para>

        <para>The performance of urban conveyance networks is dependent on the effectiveness of the

            the network. Relationships for the capacity of inlet structures determine the magnitudes

                runoff. However this objective must also include the safety and convenience of
                pedestrians, cyclists and motorists, and costs of infrastructure. Open pit
                structures that may provide the greatest inlet capacity are unacceptable in most

                installation of two or three standard pits. Grates and depressions of inlet
                structures should not be hazardous to road users, including cyclists, and their use

            <para>There is limited information on simple relationships available for the capacity of
                many types of inlet structures. Many investigations of pit entry capacities have
                utilised hydraulic models. A range of significant historical studies were published
                by <citation>b9_c5_r5+1</citation>, the <citation>b9_c5_r36+1</citation>,
                    <citation>b9_c5_r6+1</citation> and <citation>b9_c5_r7+1</citation>. More
                general information about capacities of inlet structure are provided by
                    <citation>b9_c5_r8+1</citation>, <citation>b9_c5_r9+1</citation>,
                    <citation>b9_c5_r7+1</citation>, <citation>b9_c5_r35+1</citation>, and
                    <citation>b9_c5_r10+1</citation>.</para>
            <para>More recent laboratory experiments have examined capacities of different inlet
                structures at the Manly Hydraulics Laboratory in NSW and at the University of South
                Australia. The relationships obtained from laboratory tests do not extend to flow
                rates that may occur in extreme flood events such as 1% AEP or probable maximum
                floods. However, these relationships are still useful for most design problems as
                inlet structures in urban areas are predominantly used to admit inflows from minor
                or more frequent events into conveyance networks. </para>
            <para>The US Federal Highway Administration <citation>b9_c5_r11</citation> has published
                the general procedure for determining inflow capacities of on-grade pits in their
                Hydraulic Engineering Circular No. 22 (HEC-22). The efficiency of various grate
                types and impacts on inlet capacities for a range of approach grades and velocities
                are important considerations for urban conveyance networks. In addition to grate and
                kerb inlets, the capacities of slotted drain inlet structures are also relevant for
                locations where interception of wide sheet flow is desirable and low sediment and
                debris is expected. The HEC-22 pit inlet procedures are a useful source of
                information to aid design of inlet structures.</para>

                behaviour of on-grade and sag pits is quite different. These differences are
                discussed below.</para><para><emphasis role="bold">Sag Inlet Pits </emphasis></para><para>The capacities of sag pits are generally independent of
                upstream gutter slopes and are governed by weir and orifice equations which are
                dependent on the depth of ponding. The weir equations apply to flows that enter the
                pit at its edges or at the edges of bars in a grate. Alternatively orifice equations
                are applied when water ponds above the inlet structure at depths typically exceeding
                about 0.2 m. The depth of ponding increases to a threshold level and stormwater will
                overflow as bypass flow by passing over a ‘weir‘ such as a road crown or driveway
                hump or wall.</para>
            <para>The approach and cross-fall grades of roads can affect the
            availability of storage volumes surrounding sag pits which can indirectly affect the
            overall behaviour of sag pits. These issues can be considered using hydrodynamic
            analysis of sag pits as small detention structures. Sag pits must have sufficient inflow
            capacity to accept the total inflows of stormwater runoff to avoid undesirable ponding
            of stormwater in intersections to limit obstruction to turning traffic, onto footpaths,
            into adjacent private properties or basement car parks, or over the crown of a road
            during a minor storm.</para>
            <para>Basic calculations for determining approximate inlet
                relationships for grated sag pits were derived by <citation>b9_c5_r8+1</citation>.
                However, it is preferable to utilise the HEC 22 procedures rather than the sag pit

            <para>Significant pressure losses may be created by inlet structures and junctions in
                conveyance networks. Hydraulic losses are generally reduced when open channel flows
                occur in conveyance infrastructure (pipes) and benching or smooth transitioning is
                provided within inlet structures. Higher losses occur at inlet structures when
                conveyance infrastructures (pipes) are full and surcharging in response to pressure
                flows. These losses at pits are offset by the increased capacity of pressurised
                pipes and the entire pressurised conveyance network may cope with greater flow
                rates.  Energy losses at inlet structures are expressed as a function of the

                lines (measured by manometers in the upstream and downstream pipes) forwards or

            <para>Studies using hydraulic models can be used to derive reliable values of energy
                losses and pressure changes for different types of pits and junctions. A significant
                study by <citation>b9_c5_r14+1</citation> dealt with pipes flowing full and produced
                a set of design aids for a selected configuration of inlet structures which are now
                called “Missouri Charts”. <citation>b9_c5_r15+1</citation>;
                    <citation>b9_c5_r16+1</citation> produced information on other configurations.
                The charts are complex and provide many possible geometric configurations of inlet
                structures. Careful judgement is required to select the appropriate chart for a
                particular configuration of a structure, and in practice, iterative calculations are
                required to converge to a suitable value of the pressure loss coefficient.</para>
            <para>This iterative process can be quite time consuming for large conveyance networks.
                Attempts have been made to replace dependence on charts with semi-analytical
                methods. These range from relatively simple methods suggested by
                    <citation>b9_c5_r10+1</citation>, <citation>b9_c5_r33+1</citation> and
                    <citation>b9_c5_r17+1</citation> to more in-depth methods suggested by
                    <citation>b9_c5_r18+1</citation> and the US FHWA HEC-22 procedure from which the
                algorithm described by <citation>b9_c5_r19+1</citation> and
                    <citation>b9_c5_r20+1</citation> has been developed. The FHWA HEC-22 procedure
                was developed using research and laboratory efforts improving the methodologies of
                the ‘Corrective Coefficient Energy-Loss Method’ <citation>b9_c5_r40</citation> and
                the ‘Composite Energy Loss Method” <citation>b9_c5_r21+1</citation>. It is also the
                only method which considers part-full and full pipe flow, drops in pits and other
                situations.</para>
            <para>A summary paper by <citation>b9_c5_r22+1</citation> compared the different
                algorithms and could not find significant differences which suggested that no single
                method was superior. However, the information indicated that a viable algorithm can
                be developed, and that further testing and development is required for the methods
                to acceptably match the full range of configurations of inlet structures provided by
                the <citation>b9_c5_r16+1</citation>. The FHWA algorithm appears to provide a
                significant advance in the determination of head losses and pit pressure changes in
                stormwater conveyance networks. Comparisons with alternative algorithms and
                experimental data indicated that simpler methods may provide equivalent results for
                losses.</para>

            <para>Large energy losses and pressure changes can be avoided by attention to simple
                rules in detailed design and construction. One principle is to ensure that jets of

                possible the stormwater jets from inflow should be directed into outlet pipes.

            <para>The complexity of conveyance networks requires that simple calculations based on
                energy gradients are often replaced by more complex procedures. Rainfall runoff is
                collected at multiple entry points (inlet structures) and accumulates throughout the
                conveyance network. The necessary calculations combine these inflows and route them

            <para><xref linkend="b9_ch5_f_bfuec"/>(a) demonstrates a simple model that accepts peak
                inflows derived from a hydrological model. It is assumed that steady flows occur in
                each pipe reach or link. Hydraulic grade lines are assumed to be located at the
                obvert (upper inside surface) of pipes and the flow condition is described as
                “flowing full but not under pressure”. Allowances for local losses are provided by a
                small drop (up to 90 mm, depending on change of flow direction) within inlet
                structures. The capacity of pipes can be calculated easily by applying a friction
                formula such as the Manning Equation and accounting for the grade of the pipe. The
                conveyance network is assumed to behave as a network of open channels and no
                allowance is made for upstream or downstream surcharges. </para>
            <para><xref linkend="b9_ch5_f_bfuec"/>(b) shows a second approach to hydraulic analysis
                that also assumes steady-state conditions where peak flows occur as pressure flows
                in pipes and the HGL is located above or along the pipe obvert. This method includes
                energy losses and pressure changes at inlet structures that are likely to be greater
                than open channel flow assumptions where water levels are below pipe obverts.
                Capacity of pipes is also dependent on downstream water levels which may create
                backwater effects on flows in pipes.</para>
            <para>These methods accept peak flow from hydrological models and assume that peak flows
                occur simultaneously throughout the conveyance network. Flow rates are constant
                within each link and the calculated HGLs and EGLs represent upper envelopes of these
                flows. This process will usually estimate lower pipe capacities than unsteady flow
                assumptions.</para>
            <para><xref linkend="b9_ch5_f_bfuec"/>(c) presents unsteady flow processes that are
                created by the inflow to the conveyance network of full hydrographs typically
                generated in computer models and real rainfall depths and patterns. The simulations
                account for the changes in water levels and flow characteristics in pipes and the
                network throughout storm events. These processes include dynamic effects such as
                fast-travelling waves generated by changes in flow conditions that can create shock
                losses in the conveyance network. This model is applied using computers that process
                and solve finite difference computations. A steady flow system is assumed to be
                independent of time and only requires one set of calculations. However calculations
                in computer models of unsteady flows are repeated for many time steps and pipe
                reaches are divided into several sections during the calculation processes.</para>
            <para>All three hydraulic models can be utilised for design and analysis. The first and
                simplest method can be used for design of small networks where downstream conditions
                may ultimately be varied to account for the actual behaviour of the conveyance
                network. These adjustments may not be possible for design of a fixed conveyance
                network, and the estimated capacities and impacts of conveyance network may be
                incorrect.</para>
            <para>The assumed steady-state flows and a connected hydraulic grade line throughout a
                network of the second method is more suitable for basic design and analysis tasks.
                This method is likely to provide more efficient designs as it more closely
                reproduces real hydraulic behaviour and allows for surcharging of pits and pressure
                flows. This process may be used as a checking procedure by working backwards from
                the receiving water level towards the top of the catchment.</para>
            <para>This model was presented by ARR 1987 <citation>arr_1987</citation> as the
                preferred hand calculation method for hydraulic design of simple pipe networks.
                Calculations typically involve two iterations for a conveyance network. The first
                iteration commences at the top of the catchment, accumulating the flows arriving at
                each inlet structure, and allows for possible bypass flows at pits. The calculated
                flows through the conveyance network are used to determine the sizes of pipes and
                the invert levels at their ends whilst ensuring that HGLs do not rise above a limit,
                usually 0.15 m below the surface level of inlet structures. This design procedure
                involves a series of trials with increasing pipe sizes selected from the
                commercially available diameters. The smallest commercially available pipe diameters
                that meet the design requirements are typically selected.</para>
            <para>The iteration of the calculations commence at the outlet using a set tailwater
                level and project the HGLs upward towards the top of the catchment by considering
                the HGL slope due to pipe friction and the local pressure changes at each inlet
                structure. The previously calculated flow rates, pipe diameters and water levels in
                pits can be used in design charts such as the Missouri and Hare charts to determine
                local pressure changes at pits (refer to <xref linkend="b9_ch5_s_wtcce"/>). When the
                upstream process of calculations reaches an inlet structure with two or more pipe
                branches, the calculations progress separately and upstream in each branch.</para>
            <para>This projection process can be employed for part-full pipe flows, and for
                pressurised and full-pipe flows. However, the straight water surface profiles
                assumed for part-full flows will not be exact. A more accurate procedure is to
                project water surfaces upstream using the gradually-varied flow methods commonly
                called backwater curve computations.</para>
            <para>Some designers of conveyance networks are still using the simple, steady flow
                procedures. However the unsteady flow models produce more realistic behaviours in
                response to hydrographs and flow volumes that are essential for analysis volume
                sensitive systems that include volume management facilities (refer to <xref
                    linkend="b9_ch4"/>). Modelling using unsteady hydraulic (and hydrology)
                assumptions is the preferred method for detailed analysis of conveyance networks
                that need to respond to strict constraints and where realistic modelling of network
                behaviour is needed. This approach is also essential for analysis of existing
                conveyance networks to replicate an existing deficit in performance or to reproduce
                a known flooding problem. There are many software products currently available that
                can be utilised for these types of analysis and design (refer to <xref

                flows travelling towards a receiving watercourse or an inlet structure in a

                undesirably through private property. Calculations for overland flows are similar to
                open channels in that they can be defined as a number of different channel sections
                with constant cross-sections and slopes. However a key difference between overland
                flow paths and open channels is that overland flow paths are typically limited to

                assumptions may be used in the absence of more precise information. Typical values
                of Manning's n are 0.012 for concrete, 0.014 for asphalt, 0.018 for flush seal and

                in <xref linkend="b9_ch5_f_s9bk8"/>(b). </para>
            <para>Open channel flow equations, such as the Manning Equation, can also be used to
                determine flows in lined gutters or unlined drains or swales.</para>
            <para>Flow depths and widths for a specified flow rate can be determined using <xref
                    linkend="b9_ch5_e_dzy0v"/>. Velocities are estimated by dividing the flow rate
                by the corresponding flow area. Travel times for stormwater conveyance can be
                derived by dividing gutter length by flow velocity. Distributed lateral inflows as
                shown in <xref linkend="b9_ch5_f_s9bk8"/>(c) can generate flow rates and
                characteristics such as width, depth and velocity that vary along a gutter. In this
                situation the average flow velocity occurs at about 60% of the distance along the
                gutter towards the inlet structure. Gutter flow calculations that use of the total
                flow arriving an inlet structure will overestimate velocities impacting on the
                structure.</para>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Other Considerations</emphasis></para>
            <para>Gutter flow times depend on flow rates and it is necessary to specify a time in
                order to estimate a flow rate. A set of iterative calculations are required. In
                these calculations, a velocity or time is assumed, and a flow rate calculated. Then
                a check is undertaken to determine whether the total time of flow in the overland
                and gutter flow paths agrees with the original assumption. </para>
            <para>A precise calculation of gutter flows must allow for concentrated inflows such as
                bypass flows from an upstream pit at the upper end of the gutter or an outflow from
                a large site at some point along the gutter. A representative design flow rate must
                be estimated to permit calculation of the average velocity and travel time.</para>
            <para>Parked vehicles and driveways may interrupt and widen surface flows. The limited
                experimental evidence available suggests that these effects are localised. Allowance
                for this effect may be needed for streets where close parking of vehicles is likely
                but specific allowance does not appear necessary at other locations. The design
                process should account for possible future alterations to gutter and road profiles
                including resurfacing of roads. Effects of possible pit blockages must be assessed
                at locations where overflows may cause significant damage. </para>
            <para>Aquaplaning or hydroplaning is also an important consideration, especially for
                highway drainage. This occurs when the tyre’s inability to shed water from the
                contact patch is exceeded, resulting in a layer of water building between the tyre
                and road surface leading to a loss of traction that prevents the vehicle from
                responding to control inputs. Although aquaplaning is dependent on other geometric
                factors of road design, adequate sizing and placement of inlet structures and cross
                culvert drainage systems is also a significant factor in reducing the risk of sheet
                flow occurring on roads. For guidance on aquaplaning, or highway drainage in
                general, refer to sources such as Austroads <citation>b9_c5_r300</citation>, road
                transport authority guidelines for each state and territory, the FHWA or UK Highway
                Agency.</para>
            <para>It is also important to consider the longevity of an overland flow path and this
                is especially relevant for flow paths through private property. Blockages are likely
                to occur due to lack of maintenance, or by post construction modifications such as
                from garden beds and mulch, or by modifications designed to enclose domestic
                pets.</para>
            <para>It is often necessary to locate structures within minor overland flow paths
                including property fencing, sound-control barriers and above ground services. When
                designing overland flow paths that may contain these types of structures it is
                important to consider the potential for flows to be redirected by these barriers.

            <para>The estimation of flow rates through conveyance networks that are flowing full is
                made by relating the available energy or head to the losses as expressed by the
                velocity head. The following calculation shows how flowrates can be determined from
                the available head and the assumed energy losses along a 300 mm pipe discharging
                from a reservoir as shown in <xref linkend="b9_ch5_f_jk53i"/>. </para>

            <para>Equations using conservation of mass, energy and momentum can be constructed to
                describe the state of an entire conveyance network that includes multiple pipes and
                inlet structures. These equations are solved to provide information about the
                pressures and velocities throughout a conveyance network which can be visualised as
                EGLs and HGLs. More complex partial differential equations are required to cope with
                unsteady flows that change with time.</para>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Conduits Flowing Partially Full</emphasis></para>
            <para>Conduits that are flowing partially full in stormwater conveyance networks can
                exhibit complex behaviours. A maximum flow capacity is achieved when conduits are
                operating at less than full flows. However it is not good practice to design
                conduits with partial flows as disturbances may eliminate free surfaces in conduits
                and cause a transition to pressurized full flows that may lead to surcharges.</para>
            <para>This assumes that flows in conduits are open channel flows with atmospheric
                pressure at the surface. Submergence at the entrance and tailwater levels affecting
                the outlet of conduits generates further complications. In addition, large air
                bubbles and air pockets can occur in conduits that operate in partially full
                conditions resulting in pressures that can be above or below atmospheric pressure.
                The theory of open channel hydraulics is addressed in <xref linkend="book6"
                />.</para>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Complex Procedures</emphasis></para>
            <para>A more complex and correct procedure for analysis of conveyance networks is to
                apply partial differential equations of unsteady flow varying in space (the distance
                along a conduit) x and time t that is defined as steps or intervals. These numerical
                models divide river, channel or pipe reaches into segments and define the transfer
                of mass and momentum between adjacent segments using the <emphasis role="italic"
                    >Saint Venant Equations</emphasis> for conservation of mass and momentum in
                unsteady flows as described in <xref linkend="b6_ch2"/>. The equations must be
                solved iteratively using finite difference or finite element models and matrix
                calculations that may require longer computing times. </para>
            <para>These more complex calculation processes are quite different from water surface
                projection methods such as the ‘standard step’ procedure. Nevertheless the same
                outputs are produced such the HGL levels at points along a conduit and at different
                times during a flow event. The equations allow for pipe friction and local losses,
                and also incorporate pressure changes at inlet pits and junctions.</para>
            <para>Modelling of urban conveyance networks is typically carried out using a range of
                computer software packages that provide different levels of rigour or precision
                which involve trade-offs between speed and accuracy. However the designer should be
                aware of other important considerations such as stability. Unlikely high or low
                pressures, water levels, and flow rates are generated when iterative calculations
                become unstable. The usual way of achieving stable results with a computer model is
                to choose a shorter time step or adjustment of factors affecting the relative time
                steps in space and time. Small errors in volumes or flows (typically &lt; 1%) can be
                accepted in order to achieve faster running times.</para>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Priessmann Slot</emphasis></para>
            <para>Methods of analysis must allow for flows that change from partially full to full
                conduit flows and back again. Modelling procedures that account for unsteady flow
                regimes employ the Priessmann Slot assumption. This mixed flow problem is simplified
                by the addition of a hypothetical slot in the pipe which allows the depth of flow to
                exceed the pipe diameter and provides pressurized flow effects <citation>b9_c5_r26,
                    b9_c5_r27</citation>. The width of the slot must not be too wide to
                significantly impact on continuity and should be determined to ensure that the
                gravity wave speed equals the pressure wave speed. </para>
            <para>The hypothetical slot allows the analysis of the conveyance network to be treated
                as an open channel flow problem. However, a limitation of this approach is that it
                cannot accurately simulate the formation and impact of air pockets or negative
                pressures results from shocks.</para>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Outlet Structures</emphasis></para>
            <para>Regardless of whether flow within the conduit is full or part full, suitable
                transition is required at the end of a conveyance conduit, where flow discharges to
                the receiving environment. The transition structure, or outlet structure should
                accommodate potential for high velocity and/or turbulent flow. This can be achieved
                through armouring of the surface using material such as rock or concrete, along with
                gradual transition of geometry from that of the conduit, to that of the receiving
                channel or basin. Energy dissipation and/or flow dispersion can be achieved at the
                same time using appropriate outlet structure design. This is particularly necessary
                where stormwater settlement processes are expected in a receiving basin structure
                such as a bio-retention basin or constructed wetland. </para>
            <para>The outlet structure may also represent an opportunity for removal of
                gross-pollutants prior to stormwater passing into a receiving channel or structure.
                This can be achieved using various forms of screens, baskets and mechanical filters.
                The impact of these structures, whether clear, partially blocked or fully blocked on
                the hydraulic performance of the conveyance infrastructure needs careful assessment
                at the design stage.</para>

                relationship changes depending on the headwater elevation. It is also possible to
                have two different flow rates at the same water elevation which depends on whether
                the culvert is operating as an inlet or outlet controlled system. These states can
                also depend on whether flows are increasing or decreasing.</para>

            <para>A range of design aids are generally available in the form of nomographs used to
                calculate headwater levels for various situations involving circular, box and other
                types of culverts. A better approach is to use computer software to model culvert
                hydraulics.</para>
            <para><emphasis role="bold">Outlet Controls</emphasis></para>
            <para>Outlet control occurs when a culvert is not capable of conveying as much flow as
                the inlet can accept. The controlling section is generally at the culvert exit where
                subcritical or pressurised flow conditions are occurring or further downstream of
                the culvert due to tailwater conditions. Two outlet-controlled situations are
                provided in <xref linkend="b9_ch5_f_wwdiq"/>. The difference between upstream
                headwater and the tailwater levels drives the flows through the culvert. Energy
                losses are added and equated to the available head.</para>

            <para>These calculations involve backwards projection of the HGL that commences at the
                tailwater level if this submerges the outlet. Different computer models make various
                assumptions for free outfalls. It is assumed that the level will be half way between
                the pipe obvert and the critical depth, and it is necessary to determine that
                critical depth from nomographs or equations. However other computer models assume
                that it is the lower of (a) the critical depth and (b) the normal depth.</para>

            <para>Culvert and overflow weir outflows can be combined into a composite relationship
                as shown in <xref linkend="b9_ch5_f_htvy0"/>. This calculation should account for
                inlet and outlet controls and usually the most conservative relationship that
                provides the lowest flow rate for a given depth is accepted.</para>
            <para>The real behaviour of a culvert is more complex and involves a phenomenon called
                'priming'. As upstream water levels rise, culverts tend to remain under inlet
                control until they run full. As upstream water levels decline, culverts tend to
                remain at full flows in an outlet control configuration until there is a sudden
                reversion to inlet control and decline in headwater level.</para>
            <para>Since culverts are often used as outlets for detention basins and conveyance
                networks. The relationships presented above can be applied to specify the elevation
                and discharge relationships needed for routing of flows through volume management
                facilities.</para>
