        <para>There are dramatic changes in quantity, quality and timing of water leaving the

          <citation>b9_c2_r66+1</citation> that estimated a total annual volume of 608 GL.</para>
      <para>** there are less properties connected to centralised wastewater networks than

      <para><xref linkend="b9_ch2_t_oz1hg"/> demonstrates that each region is subject to
        substantially greater volumes of stormwater runoff than demands for mains water. In
        addition, the volumes of wastewater discharges are similar to water demands. However, this
        result may be misleading as there are less wastewater connections (especially Perth) than
        water supply connections in each region. Households in some areas are reliant on local
        wastewater management measures (such as septic tanks) and receive mains water supplies. </para>

      <para><xref linkend="b9_ch2_f_tm46g"/> indicates how the Ballarat Water District was dependent
        on surface water from nearby dams on local waterways [surface water (local)], until the
        worst of the drought in 2006. The reduced flows into local dams were supplemented using
        local ground water and the surface water imported from the Goulburn River (Murray-Darling
        Basin). Citizen's actions to reduce water use in response to water restrictions,
        installation of water efficient appliances and rainwater harvesting also halved the demands
        for utility water supply [water use (metred)] of the Ballarat Water District. The Council
        and the Water Authority also implemented stormwater harvesting and wastewater reuse
        solutions. In combination with the availability of ground water and imported surface water
        from the Goulburn River, these actions ensured that the City of Ballarat did not exhaust
        water supplies during drought. Despite
        <?oxy_delete author="testoni" timestamp="20181103T190931+1100" content="the "?>rainwater and
        stormwater harvesting, there were still substantial stormwater runoff events suggesting that
        additional water was available albeit at additional cost. </para>
      <para>The integrated action across the water cycle by the entire Ballarat community was a
        success from a water supply perspective that demonstrates the value of integrated solutions
        and understanding urban water balances. Nevertheless, this example also highlights the
        variable and temporal nature of urban water balances and connectivity with surrounding
        systems. Some of the key insights highlighted in <xref linkend="b9_ch2_f_tm46g"/> are that
        substantial stormwater runoff events occur during drought, annual volumes of wastewater
        discharges were similar to water demands during water restrictions. Increases in stormwater
        runoff drive increases in wastewater discharges to be greater than water demands. The
        integrated solution for Ballarat was able to overcome the jurisdictional and institutional
        boundary conditions that limit opportunities for catchment based solutions in many cases.

      <para>Understanding the conveyance of water in urban areas during times of overland flooding
        is a critical part of the analysis and design of urban stormwater management strategies. The
        major/minor principle requires that overland flow paths must be considered once the capacity
        of conveyance conduits is exceeded. This behaviour can be complex. Modelling of overland
        flow paths is used in many areas to guide zoning of land to control development and so
        reduce flood risk <citation>b9_c2_r5</citation>.</para>
      <para>The catchment boundary for overland flows will often differ from boundaries of flows in
        conduits. This means that the behaviour of large floods may be substantially different from
        smaller events and has the potential to produce unexpected behaviours. An example is a
        suburb protected from riverine flooding by a levee. Stormwater is usually discharged under
        the levee into the river. If overland stormwater flooding cannot reach the river because of
        the levee it may, instead, back up and cause flooding. This type of unexpected and rapid
        flooding can be dangerous, as people are unlikely to be prepared for these types of events. </para>

      <para>Many urban areas are adjacent to estuaries or bays that are the downstream boundary for
        water levels in streams. Coincident stormwater and estuarine flooding needs to be considered
        and is addressed in detail in <xref linkend="b6_ch5"/>. Water authorities will often have
        mandated sea levels that must be used as part of the analysis flooding scenarios for
        planning (e.g; <citation>b9_c2_r48+1</citation>). </para>
      <para>Major rivers flowing through urban centres are also receivers of urban stormwater. These
        rivers will determine the base level to be used for modelling and additional analysis of the
        river system may be required to ensure flood risks are adequately considered.</para>
      <para>The impact of urbanisation on major rivers can be contrasted with the effect on urban
        stormwater conveyance systems. Much of the water that is used in cities is harvested from
        the rivers that flow through them, for example, the Yarra River in Melbourne, the
        Hawkesbury-Nepean in Sydney and the Brisbane River. This results in lower flows and reduces
        flooding in main streams. There is a paradox here. The main rivers in urban areas have much
        reduced flow while in urban waterways flows are increased. For example, in Melbourne, there
        is about 125 km of streams and estuaries where flow has been substantially decreased by
        harvesting for urban water supply, and 1700 km of urban streams with substantially increased
        flow from urban catchments. From a citywide perspective, stormwater management needs to
        consider both of these impacts.</para>

      <para>The discussion in this section has generally assumed that suburbs have separate sanitary
        sewers and stormwater management systems. This is mostly true for Australian towns and
        cities. However, two areas have combined sewers – a single pipe that carries both wastewater
        and stormwater. These are the central area of Launceston, Tasmania and a small area in the
        CBD of Sydney. When the first sewers were built in Sydney, around 1857, there were five
        combined sewer systems: Woolloomooloo, Blackwattle Bay, Hay Street, Tank Stream and
        Bennelong. These discharged to Sydney Harbour. Most of these original sewers were converted
        to carry stormwater only following the construction of the Bondi Ocean Outfall Sewer in 1889
        and wastewater was discharged in the ocean. Later developments in Sydney and elsewhere
        adopted separate stormwater drainage.</para>
