    <title>The Urban Hydrologic Cycle</title>
    <para>Hydrologic analysis for both urban and non-urban situations begins with the water cycle.
      In rural areas, hydrologists are concerned with catchment inputs, especially rainfall, outputs
      such as evaporation and runoff, and water storage. The fundamental processes are the same for
      urban catchments, however, development profoundly changes water storages and flows (<xref
        linkend="b9_ch2_f_7wog2"/>): </para>
    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Inputs increase as mains water is supplied to urban catchments along with
          rainfall.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>Less water is stored within urban catchments. Paved surfaces replace much of the
          landscape to diminish infiltration of rainfall into soil profiles. Hydraulically efficient
          conveyance networks rapidly remove surface water from urban areas.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>There are dramatic changes in quantity, quality and timing of water leaving the
          catchment. Runoff volumes are often substantially increased. Wastewater networks provide
          an alternative flow path that interacts with stormwater and groundwater. There may be less
          opportunities for water to evaporate if it can quickly drain from a catchment.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>
    <para>The change in the rate and volume of inputs, outputs and storage explains the hydrologic
      behaviour in urban areas: the rapid response to rainfall and increased flood magnitude and
      frequency that correlates with development. This chapter explores aspects of urban hydrology,
      the impact of development and urban stormwater conveyance networks, focussing on areas where
      the effect of urbanisation needs to be considered for estimation of floods.</para>

      <title>Urban Water Balance</title>
      <para>The hydrological cycle must be considered at different temporal and spatial scales to
        gain an insight into urban hydrology. A water balance can identify the influence of imported
        water on catchment hydrology at the spatial scale of a suburb or city. </para>
      <para>The water balance for an urban catchment, during a selected time period, can be
        expressed by equating the change in the amount of for water stored to the sum of catchment
        inputs minus the sum of catchment outputs <citation>b9_c2_r49</citation>.</para>

            <para>Wastewater leaving a catchment should be less than 59% to 86% of the amount of
              water imported, since imported water contributes to stormwater and evapotranspiration.
              This means that imported water contributes to stormwater and/or evapotranspiration. As
              a result, stormwater plus evaporation exceeds precipitation, according to all case
              studies.</para>

        substantially greater volumes of stormwater runoff than demands for mains water. In
        addition, the volumes of wastewater discharges are similar to water demands. However, this
        result may be misleading as there are less wastewater connections (especially for Perth)

      <para>The average annual input and output of the catchment was about 830 mm. Approximately 24%
        (200 mm) of water was imported to the catchment via the supply system. Precipitation
        (rainfall) contributed the remaining 630 mm. Outputs included actual evapotranspiration
        (61%, 508 mm), stormwater runoff (24%, 203 mm) and wastewater discharge (14%, 118 mm). </para>
      <para>The volume of imported water exceeded the volume of wastewater in all years and thus
        contributed to stormwater runoff, and at least in the driest years, to evapotranspiration.
        More water left the catchment as evapotranspiration and as stormwater runoff than was input
        via precipitation. In addition, in all but the driest years, wastewater and stormwater were
        greater than imported water, indicating the potential for harvest of suburban discharges to
        meet water demands. This highlighted the requirements for water imports under drought
        conditions.</para>
      <para>Climate had a substantial influence on several of the water fluxes. Annual precipitation
        was highly variable ranging between 214 mm to 914 mm. On average, there was three times as
        much rainfall as water imports but in the driest year, more water was imported to the
        catchment than fell as rainfall. In the wettest year, imported water made up only 13% of
        water input. <xref linkend="b9_ch2_f_clxee"/> shows the relative amounts of precipitation
        and imported water for the driest, average and wettest years. The area of pie charts are

        proportion of imported water increases in drier years.</para>
      <para>Considering outputs, the largest term is evapotranspiration, which represents 59% or
        more for each year. Although the total evapotranspiration varies between 347 mm and 605 mm
        for dry and wet years, the proportion of water lost as evapotranspiration is reasonably
        constant (59% to 66%). <xref linkend="b9_ch2_f_a51lf"/> shows that relative amounts of
        actual evapotranspiration, stormwater and wastewater for the driest, average and wettest
        years (area of pie chart is proportional to total output). The proportion of stormwater
        increases in wetter years.. The proportion of stormwater increases during wetter years. The
        total volume and percentage of wastewater output does not seem to be greatly influenced by
        climate, as it is consistent between wet, average and dry years. </para>
      <para>Stormwater runoff is highly reliant on climate, changing by a factor of about 4 mm from

        the hydrologic cycle. Water is imported into urban catchments and this exceeds the amount of
        wastewater exported, therefore there must be a net increase in outputs. Data from Curtin in

      <title>Implications of the Urban Water Balance: Stormwater as a Resource</title>
      <para>Stormwater management throughout Australia was the subject of a recent Senate inquiry
        that recognised urban stormwater runoff as an under-utilised resource that creates
        significant environmental and flooding challenges <citation>b9_c2_r19</citation>. Urban
        areas generate substantially greater stormwater runoff and pollutant loads compared to
        natural landscapes and are degrading our urban waterways and receiving waters. These
        additional flows substantially increase the discharges and overflows from sewer networks.
        The volumes of stormwater runoff from urban areas exceed the water demand in many cities. </para>
      <para>The water balance in cities include stormwater runoff, wastewater discharges and
        imported reticulated mains water. To illustrate this, <xref linkend="b9_ch2_f_e4f23"/>
        presents the average annual water balance from the perspective of households in a range of
        Australian cities <citation>b9_c2_r20</citation>.</para>

        and wastewater discharging from households (and their properties) in each of the cities are
        greater than the volume of imported reticulated water supply at each location. Indeed, the
        average annual volumes of stormwater runoff from residential properties is similar to or
        greater than the average reticulated water demand from most of the properties. Improving
        stormwater management provides an opportunity to supplement urban water supplies as well as
        enhancing the amenity of urban areas and protecting the health of waterways in most cities. </para>

      <para><xref linkend="b9_ch2_f_tm46g"/> indicates how the Ballarat Water District was dependent
        on surface water from nearby dams on local waterways [surface water (local)], until the
        worst of the drought in 2006. The reduced flows into local dams were supplemented using
        local ground water and the surface water imported from the Goulburn River (Murray-Darling
        Basin). Citizen's actions to reduce water use in response to water restrictions,
        installation of water efficient appliances and rainwater harvesting also halved the demands
        for utility water supply [water use (metred)] of the Ballarat Water District. The Council
        and the Water Authority also implemented stormwater harvesting and wastewater reuse
        solutions. In combination with the availability of ground water and imported surface water
        from the Goulburn River, these actions ensured that the City of Ballarat did not exhaust
        water supplies during drought. Despite rainwater and stormwater harvesting, there were still
        substantial stormwater runoff events suggesting that additional water was available albeit
        at additional cost. </para>
      <para>The integrated action across the water cycle by the entire Ballarat community was a
        success from a water supply perspective that demonstrates the value of integrated solutions
        and understanding urban water balances. Nevertheless, this example also highlights the
        variable and temporal nature of urban water balances and connectivity with surrounding
        systems. Some of the key insights highlighted in <xref linkend="b9_ch2_f_tm46g"/> are that
        substantial stormwater runoff events occur during drought, annual volumes of wastewater
        discharges were similar to water demands during water restrictions. Increases in stormwater
        runoff drive increases in wastewater discharges to be greater than water demands. The
        integrated solution for Ballarat was able to overcome the jurisdictional and institutional
        boundary conditions that limit opportunities for catchment based solutions in many cases.

      <para><citation>b9_c2_r9+1</citation> suggests a similar decrease in evapotranspiration in

      <para>Increased frequency of stormwater runoff is correlated with increased area of impervious
        surfaces. Small rainfall events of 1 to 2 mm will cause runoff from impervious surfaces
          <citation>b9_c2_r2,b9_c2_r18,b9_c2_r11,b9_c2_r61</citation> but much more rainfall is
        usually required to produce runoff from grassland or forest
          <citation>b9_c2_r35,b9_c2_r34</citation>. The frequency of stormwater runoff can increase
        by a factor of ten or more. </para>
      <para>The increased responsiveness of urban landscapes to rainfall means that seasonality of
        flows in urban streams is different to rural streams. In many areas, rural catchments will
        only produce runoff after saturation of soil profiles following long periods where rainfall
        exceeds evapotranspiration. This result produces seasonal stream flows in many rural
        catchments with little runoff, when catchments are dry even when there is heavy rainfall
          <citation>b9_c2_r62</citation>. In urban streams, flows occur anytime there is rainfall.
        In temperate urban catchments, the largest urban runoff often occurs following intense
        thunderstorm rain during summer when, in equivalent rural catchment, there is little flow

      <para>The importance of stormwater conveyance was confirmed in catchments with similar
        imperviousness but with and without conventional drainage infrastructure. This alteration of
        hydraulic behaviour was substantially reduced in suburbs with less efficient informal
        stormwater infrastructure that included roofs drained to gardens or rainwater tanks, and
        sealed roads which lacked curbs and drained to surrounding forest or earthen or vegetated
        swales <citation>b9_c2_r31,b9_c2_r60</citation>. </para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Conveyance of Flood Flows</emphasis></para>
      <para>Understanding the conveyance of water in urban areas during times of overland flooding
        is a critical part of the analysis and design of urban stormwater management strategies. The
        major/minor principle requires that overland flow paths must be considered once the capacity
        of conveyance conduits is exceeded. This behaviour can be complex. Modelling of overland
        flow paths is used in many areas to guide zoning of land to control development and so
        reduce flood risk <citation>b9_c2_r5</citation>.</para>
      <para>The catchment boundary for overland flows will often differ from boundaries of flows in
        conduits. This means that the behaviour of large floods may be substantially different from
        smaller events and has the potential to produce unexpected behaviours. An example is a
        suburb protected from riverine flooding by a levee. Stormwater is usually discharged under
        the levee into the river. If overland stormwater flooding cannot reach the river because of
        the levee it may, instead, back up and cause flooding. This type of unexpected and rapid
        flooding can be dangerous, as people are unlikely to be prepared for these types of events. </para>

      <title>Receiving Environments</title>
      <para>Many urban areas are adjacent to estuaries or bays that are the downstream boundary for
        water levels in streams. Coincident stormwater and estuarine flooding needs to be considered
        and is addressed in detail in <xref linkend="b6_ch5"/>. Water authorities will often have
        mandated sea levels that must be used as part of the analysis flooding scenarios for
        planning (e.g; <citation>b9_c2_r48+1</citation>). </para>
      <para>Major rivers flowing through urban centres are also receivers of urban stormwater. These
        rivers will determine the base level to be used for modelling and additional analysis of the
        river system may be required to ensure flood risks are adequately considered.</para>
      <para>The impact of urbanisation on major rivers can be contrasted with the effect on urban
        stormwater conveyance systems. Much of the water that is used in cities is harvested from
        the rivers that flow through them, for example, the Yarra River in Melbourne, the
        Hawkesbury-Nepean in Sydney and the Brisbane River. This results in lower flows and reduces
        flooding in main streams. There is a paradox here. The main rivers in urban areas have much
        reduced flow while in urban waterways flows are increased. For example, in Melbourne, there
        is about 125 km of streams and estuaries where flow has been substantially decreased by
        harvesting for urban water supply, and 1700 km of urban streams with substantially increased
        flow from urban catchments. From a citywide perspective, stormwater management needs to
        consider both of these impacts.</para>

      <title>Combined and Separate Systems</title>
      <para>The discussion in this section has generally assumed that suburbs have separate sanitary
        sewers and stormwater management systems. This is mostly true for Australian towns and
        cities. However, two areas have combined sewers – a single pipe that carries both wastewater
        and stormwater. These are the central area of Launceston, Tasmania and a small area in the
        CBD of Sydney. When the first sewers were built in Sydney, around 1857, there were five
        combined sewer systems: Woolloomooloo, Blackwattle Bay, Hay Street, Tank Stream and
        Bennelong. These discharged to Sydney Harbour. Most of these original sewers were converted
        to carry stormwater only following the construction of the Bondi Ocean Outfall Sewer in 1889
        and wastewater was discharged in the ocean. Later developments in Sydney and elsewhere
        adopted separate stormwater drainage.</para>
