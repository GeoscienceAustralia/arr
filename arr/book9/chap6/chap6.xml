    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>Urban stormwater management responds to an increasing number of performance objectives
      including mitigation of property damage, avoiding risks to human life, enhancing the amenity
      of urban settlements and protecting surrounding environments (see <xref
        linkend="b9_ch3_s_84gfv"/> and <xref linkend="b9_ch5_s_j339y"/>). This involves looking at
      the full spectrum of rain events from frequent to rare (see <xref linkend="b9_ch3"/>) from the
      perspective of flooding, water quality, provision of infrastructure, protection of
      environments and enhancing amenity of urban areas. Assessment of urban stormwater behaviour,
      performance against objectives and associated design tasks, involve complex analytical
      problems that are better resolved using a computer-based model system. </para>
    <para>A computer model involves use of software or a complex spreadsheet. Compared to hand
      calculations, computer models permit rapid numerical calculations across large spatial and
      temporal domains, while facilitating testing of multiple suites of parameters and inputs (see
        <xref linkend="b9_ch3_s_34r7g"/>). This in turn allows the model to be calibrated to best
      represent real world conditions that are under assessment. Models can be useful to assist our
      thinking, can be readily documented and reviewed, leading to better assessments and design
      outcomes. </para>
    <para>Nevertheless, reliable estimates are conditional based on best practice application of
      computer model. Remember, models are only tools to guide our thinking about design and
      management. The purpose of this chapter is to provide guidance on selection and application of
      modelling approaches within urban catchments, having regard to techniques described in other
      books of ARR. The chapter is structured as follows:</para>
    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><xref linkend="b9_ch6_s_2lxrp"/> describes tasks that are characteristic of urban
          modelling. </para>

      <listitem>
        <para><xref linkend="b9_ch6_s_rfr2v"/> discusses current trends in urban modelling. This may
          assist with planning a long-term strategy for technology adoption, research and training.
          A general description of the types of computer models applied in urban stormwater practice
          is provided as an aid for model selection.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para><xref linkend="b9_ch6_s_cj3nx"/> provides a framework for application of computer
          models to urban stormwater catchments. This discussion includes guidance for each segment
          of the catchment, from the watershed, through the urban stormwater network, and into the
          receiving waterway.</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <para>This chapter is not intended to duplicate content in other chapters. Where relevant detail
      is available elsewhere, references to other books and chapters are provided.</para>
    <para>In the context of this chapter, an ‘urban model’ can be defined as a conceptual or
      computer-based modelling system that performs hydrologic, hydraulic, water balance or water
      quality calculations, across a catchment significantly disturbed by urban development and
      associated infrastructure. This modelling system may operate across all the significant scales
      of urban areas from allotment to neighbourhood to precinct to region. Urban infrastructure of
      most direct relevance includes increased impervious surfaces, modification to natural
      conveyance areas (e.g. pits, pipes and open channels) and volume management infrastructure
      (e.g. rainwater tanks, bio-retention and basins).</para>
    <para>Emerging urban stormwater analysis and solutions are based on a systems approach that
      incorporates multiple linked scales (<xref linkend="b9_ch3"/>). The
        <citation>b9_c3_r49+1</citation> highlights that past practice of designing individual items
      of stormwater infrastructure at a single centralised scale is not enough for managing urban
      flooding and water quality in waterways. Stormwater management needs to be designed as a
      system that integrates structural and non-structural attributes of design with site
      characteristics and performance objectives.</para>
    <para>More recently, the USEPA established that green infrastructure solutions distribute at
      multiple scales throughout urban catchments partially disconnected impervious surfaces. They
      also contribute to improved stormwater quality and avoid flood damages
        <citation>b9_c6_r2</citation>. These insights are consistent with earlier Australian applied
      research finding that both peak flows and volumes of stormwater runoff are required for the
      design of stormwater infrastructure <citation>b9_c3_r54</citation>, and local scale is the
      basic building block of cumulative urban rainfall runoff processes
        <citation>b5_c3_r31</citation>.</para>
    <para>Many methods for modelling stormwater runoff are based on regional scale assumptions and
      processes. However, inclusion of local scale processes in analysis improves knowledge of
      within catchment outcomes and whole of catchment responses.</para>
    <para>It is suggested that a catchment with less than 10 percent impervious surfaces, or with
      less than 10 percent of the natural conveyance areas modified, would not be considered an
      ‘urban catchment’. In which case, the advice in this chapter may have less relevance. However,
      each catchment is different, some natural or rural catchments contain sub-catchments that are
      urbanised (for example, in semi-urban areas). The relevance of this chapter to a specific
      modelling investigation needs to be determined by the reader through application of judgement
      and experience. </para>

    <title>Urban Modelling Tasks</title>
    <para>Typical urban modelling tasks are introduced in this section to establish context for
      subsequent discussion. This section particularly focusses on those modelling tasks that are
      not typically required when modelling rural and natural catchments. This section should be
      read in conjunction with <xref linkend="book5"/>, <xref linkend="book6"/> and <xref
        linkend="book7"/> and where the reader can find information about modelling tasks and
      assumptions that are common across all catchment types (i.e. urban, semi-rural, rural and
      natural).</para>
    <para>There are some important differences between modelling of urban catchments compared with
      modelling other types of catchments. Urban areas can include: <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>A larger proportion of impervious surfaces (refer <xref linkend="b9_ch6_s_tojzw"
            />).</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist><itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Stormwater conveyance infrastructure. This includes a network of inlet structures
            and non-natural flow paths that provide for greater concentrations and velocities of
            flow (refer <xref linkend="b9_ch6_s_0k1v3"/>).</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist><itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Numerous hydraulic structures. This includes infrastructure for waterway crossings,
            temporary storage of volume, water harvesting and treatment of runoff (refer <xref
              linkend="b9_ch6_s_9pjt4"/>, <xref linkend="b9_ch6_s_y9jk6"/> and <xref
              linkend="b9_ch6_s_5envo"/>).</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist><itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>A greater variety of land uses at different scales with different connectivity to
            catchment outlets (refer <xref linkend="b9_ch6_s_cj3nx"/>)</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist></para>
    <para>The density of land uses and associated infrastructure within an urban catchment also
      changes with time. The urban modelling process must therefore consider the information needs
      of the stakeholder and ensure the temporal scenarios being modelled are relevant.</para>
    <para>There are also differences relating to availability and use of model input data. Modelling
      in urban areas has intensive requirements related to representation of urban form, land uses
      and stormwater infrastructure. Therefore, collection and collation of input data can become a
      significant component of the overall urban modelling task (refer <xref
        linkend="b9_ch6_s_mxsz7"/>).</para>
    <section xml:id="b9_ch6_s_tojzw">
      <title>Impervious Surface Estimation</title>
      <para>One of the defining characteristics of an urban catchment is presence of impervious
        surfaces such as roads, buildings, footpaths and driveways. These surfaces have an
        associated reduced infiltration loss and decreased lag in hydrologic response in comparison
        to pervious surfaces (i.e. landscaping, lawns, open space) or natural catchments. <xref
          linkend="b4ch2_s_0hsvn"/> provides further discussion of the effects of impervious cover
        on runoff from urban areas.</para>
      <para>Hydrologic modelling of urban areas requires an estimate of the proportion of impervious
        surfaces across each catchment and sub-catchment to be modelled. As described in <xref
          linkend="book5"/>, there are two main types of impervious surfaces that exist within urban
        areas:</para>
      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Impervious areas which are directly connected to the conveyance network or urban
            waterway – referred to as Directly Connected Impervious Areas (DCIA)</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Impervious areas which are indirectly connected to the conveyance network, typically
            where impervious surface runoff flows over pervious surfaces before reaching the
            conveyance network (e.g. a roof that discharges onto a lawn). These are referred to as
            Indirectly Connected Impervious Areas (ICIA). Alternatively, the responses of these
            impervious surfaces are disconnected from sub-catchment outlets by volume management
            measures (refer <xref linkend="book4"/>). </para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      <para>These two configurations of impervious surfaces provide different hydrologic responses,
        with Directly Connected Impervious Areas contributing to runoff more quickly than Indirectly
        Connected Impervious Areas (refer <xref linkend="b5_ch5_s_qqflw"/>). </para>
      <para>For large urban catchments, isolating separate hydrologic effects of these two types of
        impervious surfaces is challenging. <xref linkend="b5_ch5_s_ppgv2"/> instead describes a
        concept referred to as Effective Impervious Area (EIA) that encompasses the combined
        hydrologic effect of both directly and indirectly connected impervious areas. The estimated
        EIA value for a catchment is calculated and then applied to hydrologic calculations using
        the adopted modelling software. </para>
      <para>The approach described in <xref linkend="b5_ch5_s_ppgv2"/> involves estimation of EIA
        via linear regression of site stream flow gauge and rainfall data. In situations where there
        is insufficient available data for this technique, the ratio of EIA to Total Impervious Area
        (TIA) is established for a collection of gauged catchments that allows EIA to be estimated
        based on an estimated TIA. (Refer <xref linkend="b5_ch5_s_3gs2s"/>).</para>
      <para>TIA is a measurable catchment feature that is typically estimated using GIS methods
        (refer <xref linkend="b5_ch5_s_ih2vd"/>). The technique selection TIA estimation depends on
        catchment scale, data availability, accuracy requirements, and whetherthe catchment scenario
        being investigated relates to an existing or future condition.</para>
      <para>From <xref linkend="book5"/> the recommended ratio of EIA to TIA for majority of urban
        catchments sits within the range of 50% and 70%. For example, if the TIA for an urban
        catchment was measured as 55% then the EIA for that same catchment would be between 27.5%
        and 38.5% of the total catchment area.</para>
      <para>However, when the EIA approach is used, it is important that the characteristics of the
        catchment under investigation are compared to those of the catchments that were used to
        establish the recommended EIA to TIA ratio. Different catchments have different stormwater
        management standards and land use patterns that may alter the overall connectivity degree
        between impervious surfaces and the drainage network serving the catchment. Where there is
        higher connectivity, the EIA is also expected to be higher.</para>
      <para>For some catchment investigations where there is strong connectivity between the
        impervious surfaces and the downstream drainage system the measured TIA value may be the
        more suitable impervious surface value to be used for hydrologic modelling purposes. For
        example, analysis of a sealed carpark surface, where the entire impervious area is directly
        connected to surface inlets, is more appropriately undertaken using a TIA estimate.</para>
      <para>Also where the catchment scale is small, for example, an individual parcel of land or a
        small development site, the use of TIA values in conjunction with a sub-catchment definition
        that reflects actual stormwater connectivity may be more appropriate. To avoid over
        estimation,
        <?oxy_delete author="testoni" timestamp="20181112T173456+1100" content="practitioners"?><?oxy_insert_start author="testoni" timestamp="20181112T173456+1100"?>designers<?oxy_insert_end?>
        should use TIA for small scale catchments only when they are satisfied that all the
        impervious flow is directly connected. The effect of any volume management infrastructure
        should also be explicitly reflected in these model simulations.</para>
      <para>Consideration also needs to be given to the overall need for accuracy when deriving
        estimates of impervious cover. Majority of techniques applied by
        <?oxy_delete author="testoni" timestamp="20181112T173502+1100" content="practitioners"?><?oxy_insert_start author="testoni" timestamp="20181112T173502+1100"?>designers<?oxy_insert_end?>
        typically under or over-estimates actual impervious cover by 10 to 20 percent
          <citation>b9_c6_r16</citation>.</para>
      <para>Predicted peak discharges and runoff volumes are sensitive to error in impervious cover
        when modelling low rainfall events with event-based and continuous simulation models.
          <citation>b9_c6_r16+1</citation> observed that a difference in impervious surfaces of +/-
        10 percentage points from actual conditions, can result in typical errors of 13% in peak
        discharge and 25% in runoff volume. These errors decrease in situations where rainfall
        depths are higher and infiltration losses less significant. </para>
      <para>It is also noted that where a catchment has significant impervious cover, the
        variability of runoff is reduced in comparison to a similar pervious catchment since
        infiltration losses have less influence.</para>
      <para>Additional discussion of configurations of impervious surfaces is provided in <xref
          linkend="b9_ch6_s_rhstb"/> Local observations or information about connectivity of
        impervious surfaces should be applied in models wherever possible.</para>

      <title>Conveyance Infrastructure</title>
      <para>Urban areas typically contain significant amount of stormwater conveyance
        infrastructure, including numerous stormwater inlet structures feeding a network of other
        conveyance infrastructure such as street gutters, pipes, open channels, roadways and
        overland flow paths through open spaces. These are linked together to form continuous and
        distributed network from source to receiving waterway (refer <xref linkend="b9_ch5"
        />).</para>
      <para>While natural waterway conveyance is increasingly sought as a design objective for new
        urban areas, traditionally urban drainage systems have been designed to transfer runoff
        quickly and within a minimum corridor, often partly underground. This containment of flows
        within conduits that have artificial linings and unnatural slope leads to faster average
        flow velocity, greater volume and significantly altered flood hydrographs compared to those
        from comparably sized rural and natural catchments.</para>
      <para>To accurately represent the hydrologic and hydraulic behaviour of an urban area, the
        influence of conveyance infrastructure on routing and flow behaviour should be included
        within the adopted urban flood model. For most applications the model should be capable of
        describing the effect of conveyance infrastructure on flow characteristics such as flow
        depth, velocity, direction, surface level, and hydraulic grade line showing hydraulic losses
        including their position and size. Other important information includes the split of flow
        between minor and major flow path, maximum flow widths in gutters, maximum allowable flow
        velocity in pipes, the location and direction of any diversions and breakouts, and the
        extent of property inundation.</para>
      <para>The effect of conveyance infrastructure on these flood characteristics varies across
        different types of urban flood models. </para>
      <para>Some models reflect the performance of conveyance infrastructure explicitly, which
        requires that the modeller input a detailed physical definition of conduits and their
        hydraulic characteristics. The typical data that must be collected and input to these models include:<itemizedlist>

          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist></para>
      <para>This information must be gathered for each relevant piece of conveyance infrastructure
        that is part of the network being investigated. In some cases this data may be readily
        accessible in an asset database. In other circumstances this data may require collection via
        ground survey. When data cannot be obtained due to inaccessible structures, assumptions
        regarding the network geometry may be required.</para>
      <para>A schematic representation of the overall conveyance network, including connectivity
        between inlets, conduits and junctions is then constructed within the model.</para>
      <para>These models can be data intensive, but they also have potential to provide detailed and
        accurate descriptions of flood behaviours. </para>
      <para>Depending on the type of user interface and pre-processor associated with the adopted
        model software, some of these data requirements may be automatically harvested from other
        raw input data. For example, a 3D surface model may be used to establish roadside gutter
        profile and slope automatically. Even so, some information will be required such as in this
        case the plan position of the roadside gutter.</para>
      <para>For large urban areas, particularly those that have become densely developed over a long
        period of time, the task of collecting and collating all the dimensions of all conveyance
        infrastructure can be a major undertaking. Further complexity and effort arises since each
        inlet structure has a potential hydrologic sub-catchment that must be defined and input to
        the model. It is also possible that the size of the sub-catchment may change as flow rate
        increases. An exception is a rainfall on grid model approach where sub-catchment definition
        may not be required, but even still, substantial effort is required to ensure each inlet
        structure is capturing a realistic amount of runoff.</para>
      <para>In some cases the burden of this infrastructure definition task can be reduced through
        use of simplified models and assumptions that do not explicitly model the performance of all
        conveyance infrastructure items. For example, the capacity of underground drainage may be an
        assumed proportion of the total runoff hydrograph or in some cases totally ignored. This
        approach can be acceptable if the capacity of the underground system is small relative to
        the size of floods being investigated. In this case the model construction may instead focus
        on a more accurate definition of surface-based conveyance infrastructure and overland flow
        paths.</para>
      <para>Other models can provide flood estimates using an even more implicit description of
        conveyance infrastructure. For example, rating curves and stage hydrographs may be used for
        selected locations in conjunction with run-off routing hydrologic estimates. In this case
        less physical data needs to be collected.</para>
      <para>Any decision to simplify the description of conveyance infrastructure within a model
        needs to be made recognising the accuracy requirements of the investigation and the risks
        associated with any limitations that may be introduced. It is important that the impacts of
        simplifying models and associated assumptions are fully understood. This is further
        discussed in <xref linkend="b9_ch6_s_qz9hc"/>.</para>

      <title>Waterway Crossings</title>
      <para>Waterway crossings are urban infrastructure for the purpose of allowing access across a
        natural or manufactured waterway. The most commonly encountered waterway crossings comprise
        of causeways, culverts and bridges that are constructed as part of a vehicular, rail or
        pedestrian transport system. </para>
      <para>Waterway crossings can have considerable hydraulic impact for floods within the range
        where the crossing structure causes the cross-sectional area of the waterway to be reduced.
        In these circumstances additional energy is required to pass flow through and/or over the
        structure causing increased pressure head upstream of the crossing (afflux). Afflux is flow
        dependant and will change across the range of potential flood discharges. This afflux can
        cause a significant storage volume to be engaged upstream of embankments which can therefore
        also heavily influence downstream flood behaviour.</para>
      <para>A comprehensive description of hydraulic behaviour at waterway crossings and other
        hydraulic structures is found in <xref linkend="b6_ch3"/>.</para>

      <para>These impacts are not necessarily confined to those that are in the immediate vicinity
        of the investigation site or study area and may impact areas upstream or downstream. A
        comprehensive urban flood investigation should therefore consider the impact of each
        existing or proposed waterway crossing in the catchment (and adjoining catchment in the case
        of cross-catchment diversion) and whether they could have an impact on local flood
        behaviour.</para>
      <para>Once the relevant waterway crossings have been identified, the urban modelling task is
        then to suitably define the crossing structure within the model. This will normally include
        the physical dimensions and shape of the waterway opening beneath the crossing deck and any
        obstruction caused by associated railings, embankments and utility services. Models may also
        assist with identifying locations where bed shear stress increases are likely and the design
        of scour protection measures (see <xref linkend="b6_ch3"/>).</para>

      <title>Volume Management Infrastructure</title>
      <para> Volume management infrastructure comprises of discrete facilities, primarily for
        controlling peak discharge and volume. They can be located at almost any point within a
        drainage network and are linked by conveyance infrastructure and/or natural waterways. A
        comprehensive description of typical volume management infrastructure facilities is found in
          <xref linkend="b6_ch4"/>.</para>
      <para>The hydrologic and hydraulic impact of these facilities can be significant and will vary
        according to the design of the facility and size of the flood. For the urban modeller, the
        task associated with this infrastructure is the physical description and schematisation of
        the facility within the model. This will normally include:<itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Storage characteristics and how the volume stored varies with depth</para>

          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist></para>
      <para>The way this model task is completed will depend on the type of model being used, but
        most commonly involves entering a form of definition table describing storage volume with
        depth along with details regarding the physical dimensions and elevations of the outlet
        structure.</para>
      <para>Depending on the intended purpose of the urban modelling task, consideration should also
        be given to antecedent conditions, whether the storage is partly utilised prior to the onset
        of the storm burst and whether there is potential for blockage of the outlet structure at
        some point in time and to what extent.</para>
      <para>The hydrologic and hydraulic impact of a volume management facility may be distant from
        its physical location (upstream or downstream). The modeller must consider inclusion of all
        volume management facilities that could potentially impact the investigation site. Also, as
        proposed storage volumes increase, the critical storm duration and pattern may
        correspondingly change, necessitating the inclusion of additional rainfall scenarios into
        the suite of model tests. </para>

      <title>Water Quality Treatment Performance</title>
      <para>An increasingly common urban modelling task is the assessment of the water quality
        treatment performance associated with a water treatment facility such as those described in
          <xref linkend="b6_ch4"/>. </para>
      <para>The facilities that perform this function are often co-located or are an integral part
        of a volume management infrastructure facility. Where this is indeed the case then similar
        model inputs are required such as the basin storage and outlet characteristics. However, a
        different model platform may be necessary since the treatment process targets smaller storms
        and occurs over longer time periods. For example, event-based hydrologic models may not be a
        suitable basis for these assessments. Instead a continuous simulation-based model would be
        more suitable.</para>
      <para>In addition, further information is required to define the treatment characteristics of
        the facility. These are mostly based on empirical relationships that simply associate the
        performance of the facility with its size or alternatively retention curves that relate
        inflow and outflow concentrations of pollutants. The pollutants of most interest are gross
        pollutants, nutrients (Total Nitrogen and Total Phosphorus), and Total Suspended
        Solids.</para>

      <title>Data Collection and Collation</title>
      <para>A well organised data collection and collation process is essential in the modelling
        process. It not only ensures that the modelling is fit for purpose, but it documents the
        sources of data and how the data was interpreted and used in the model. Models often evolve
        as improvements are made or processes are changed to better represent different components.
        This task is much simpler if a good data management process has been used. </para>
      <para>It is important that the data management system properly documents the source of the
        data, the format and the date of acquisition. <xref linkend="b1_ch4"/> provides
        comprehensive advice on the use of data. A key challenge in urban catchments is that many
        urban drainage components cannot be put directly into a model but need to be schematised.
        Examples include converting a basin drawing into a stage storage table or representing a
        complex pit system. It is important that the data management system properly documents this
        process so the interpretation and schematisation is properly documented and can be reviewed
        or refined later date. While data can be classified in many ways, there are three broad
        types of data:<itemizedlist>

      <para>The digital age has changed many aspects of data collection with data often being easier
        to find but often the original data sources are unclear with merged data sets representing
        the largest part of this problem. This same problem exists in the model development process
        where many data sets are interpreted and merged. While most urban catchments are ungauged
        recent observed flood data can often be found on social media and older historical flood
        information can be found in scanned historical records and newspapers.</para>

      <title>Overall Trends in Urban Modelling</title>
      <para>The last 30 years has seen fundamental changes in the way urban stormwater assessment

        <para>Computing power is still somewhat of a constraint for hydraulic simulations. Some of

          hours or days per simulation. This may constrain the design of an urban hydraulic
          modelling investigation and means that due care must be taken when selecting a hydraulic
          model platform. A hydraulic platform and method should be chosen that has computational
          efficiency to match the problem at hand. Models with very long run times should be
          carefully managed as they usually preclude comprehensive testing, checking or calibration. </para>
        <para>The future will permit very large multi-catchment spatial domains to be modelled at
          the finest level of temporal and spatial resolution necessary, with enough speed to allow

        <para>This trend may outpace our ability to improve the underlying science and gather
          sufficient quality input data, and to respond with more informed design and management

      <para>For example, if channel routing and structure hydraulics are not aspects of the problem

        model assessments that are normally undertaken at this scale include model calculations to

      <para>At the other end of the spectrum of potential scale, an urban model may be constructed
        to represent all the stormwater catchments spanning an entire suburb or even a small city.
        These larger models are often used for the purpose of regional flood mapping, establishing
        flood levels for development purposes or the design of large-scale stormwater and road
        crossing infrastructure. </para>

      <para>Most model platforms have some limitations on which processes they can represent. A
        decision will be required at the commencement of model preparation as to whether the
        selected model and the available data are capable of achieving the required level of
        accuracy and reliability.</para>
      <para>As a result of the expected increase in the number of flood generation processes with
        scale, if a catchment investigation requires investigation across a large spatial scale,
        then the modeller can expect that a model or method with ‘strong’ estimation capabilities
        across multiple flood process areas will be necessary (refer <xref linkend="b9_ch6_t_okqdg"
        /> and <xref linkend="b9_ch6_t_kby4c"/>). </para>
      <para>For example, the Rational Method, with ‘limited’ runoff generation and surface routing
        capabilities, is not likely to be suitable for a ‘precinct’ scale estimate of peak flow as
        it cannot simulate the array of flood processes that are encountered, even in the simplest
        of catchments. However, it may be suitable at a ‘lot’ scale in circumstances where storage
        routing is not critical.</para>
      <para>If volume management infrastructure forms part of a solution, or if an understanding of
        potential impacts on downstream flooding are required, then a ‘strong’ hydrologic estimation
        method such as a runoff-routing model should be used. For most urban modelling at this point
        in time, a runoff-routing model coupled to a two-dimensional hydraulic model or pipe network
        model will provide the strongest estimation capabilities across a wide range of model
        scales. </para>
      <para>The resolution of model inputs and boundary conditions also needs to be considered.
        There is little value in developing a high resolution model with coarse lumped inflows or
        considering the performance of a complex system using a single temporal pattern. </para>

    <section xml:id="b9_ch6_s_19hh2">
      <title>Flood Magnitude</title>
      <para>The capability of each type of model also varies with magnitude of the flood being
        considered. For the smallest of floods, including frequent storms and runoff events, the
        model’s capabilities should include consideration of infiltration losses including for some
        applications the recovery of soil moisture profiles during inter-event periods and base
        flow. The importance of this capability may change depending on the level of impervious
        cover within the catchment, becoming decreasingly important as impervious cover
        increases.</para>
      <para>These capabilities are principally the domain of runoff-routing and continuous
        simulation models. Other processes that effect total runoff volume such as harvesting and
        use of rainwater may also be important considerations for smaller flood magnitudes. <xref

      <para>For the companion hydraulic calculations during small floods, and where flooding is

      <para>Where there are multiple options arising from this process, the simplest model, capable
        of the necessary calculations should be favoured. Other model selection criteria include,
        availability of sufficient input data and parameter research, output data capabilities,
        availability of other required functionality (e.g. water quality calculation), cost, and
        user familiarity with the model. A hydraulic model involves a more explicit representation
        of flow routing and how storage is represented in the catchment. Generally a hydraulic model
        will be required where there is a need to understand both flow and flood levels. One
        dimensional pipe and channel models only provide this information at key locations but are
        well suited to ‘greenfields’ subdivision design, while a two-dimensional model provides a
        detailed spatial representation of surface stormwater processes and may be more suited to
        brownfields investigations.</para>

    <section xml:id="b9_ch6_s_qz9hc">
      <title>Model Simplification</title>
      <para>In conjunction with selecting a type of model that has the necessary estimation
        capabilities and is well suited to the model scale of interest and associated smaller scale
        influences, consideration must also be given to the degree of model simplification that
        might be appropriate. </para>
      <para>When modelling at small spatial scales it is simpler to closely represent each flood
        process and its associated physical features and drainage connections explicitly. As spatial
        scale increases it is sometimes possible to adopt some model simplifications to manage data
        requirements and the general complexity of the modelling task. For example, when building a
        ‘precinct’ scale model it may be possible to omit or simplify ‘lot’ scale processes.
        However, models should not be simplified unless that consequences of spatial averaging,
        deterministic assumptions and judgements is well understood. Where simplification is
        undertaken, efforts should be made to fully understand the impacts of simplification and
        limits on validity of the model outputs. For example, by comparison of results against a
        more detailed sub-model or results generated by an alternative model.</para>
      <para>Experience and careful judgement are required when choosing to omit or simplify those
        processes that are suggested as being less important. In general the omission or
        simplification of such a process should only occur when the investigation does not demand
        highly reliable estimates, for example, for preliminary sizing of structures or where flood
        risks are low. <xref linkend="b9_ch6_t_npwo3"/> indicates those flood generation processes
        that may be less important and therefore could be considered as an opportunity for
        simplification at each different spatial scale.</para>

    <section xml:id="b9_ch6_s_28ypi">
      <title>Model Resolution</title>
      <para>Closely related to consideration of model simplification is the interrelated
        consideration of model resolution. Resolution can in this context have multiple aspects. </para>
      <para>Firstly there is spatial resolution of the model. For a hydrologic model this will
        relate to the minimum size of sub-catchments. For a hydraulic model this will relate to the
        density of sampling of the ground surface. </para>
      <para>The adopted spatial resolution of a model will govern the density of reporting locations
        i.e. where model results are output by the model software. It may also influence model
        accuracy. Through experience a modeller will develop an understanding of the optimum model
        spatial resolution for each type of model and to what degree spatial simplification can be
        tolerated.</para>
      <para>Then there is the temporal resolution of the model and the ability to extract output
        time series that are fit for purpose. For example, the temporal resolution necessary for
        regional water supply planning may be lower than required for calculation of stormwater
        harvest yield from a small catchment. In this case a degree of temporal simplification to

    <title>Application to Urban Modelling</title>
    <para>Stormwater management is subject to ongoing evolution and change. There has been
      substantial change to the practice and science of stormwater management since 1987 as
      discussed in <xref linkend="b9_ch3"/>. This version of Australian Rainfall and Runoff combines
      30 years of additional data with evolving science and professional capability to accommodate
      changes in professional and community aspirations. This process has provided a range of new
      methods, data and resources that can assist the designer to address the local challenges of
      managing stormwater runoff in urban areas. </para>
    <para>Drainage networks (also discussed in <xref linkend="b9_ch5"/>) are now considered to be
      part of more comprehensive stormwater management approaches (see <xref linkend="b9_ch3"/>)
      that respond to multiple water cycle objectives including protecting waterways, mitigating
      flood risks, provision of water resources, managing the quality of stormwater runoff and
      enhancing the amenity of urban areas. These approaches respond to a need to manage urban water
      balances (discussed in <xref linkend="b9_ch2"/>) and to also incorporate a range of storage
      measures (see <xref linkend="b9_ch4"/>) that aim to manage flooding, stormwater quality and
      provide additional water resources. </para>
    <para>This section provides a framework for application of modelling approaches to urban
      stormwater catchments. The framework provides guidance for key segments of catchments from the
      behaviour of land uses within sub-catchments that flow to inlet structures, through urban
      stormwater networks, and into the receiving waterway. </para>
    <para>A range of approaches are now available to determine the configuration of measures in a
      linked stormwater management system than may include a conveyance network, volume management
      strategies and non-structural measures. These methods can range from simple procedures to
      detailed computer modelling. The application of new rainfall data and methods to modelling
      approaches is discussed with reference to the different approaches to the design of stormwater
      management measures and systems. </para>

      <para>We should be mindful that all models are an approximation of reality that can be used to
        enhance our understanding about the likely stormwater behaviours for particular urban
        scenarios. The different hydrological and hydraulic models can be classified by their
        outputs of peak flow<?oxy_insert_start author="testoni" timestamp="20181112T135806+1100"?>
        <?oxy_insert_end?>rates, hydrographs, flood depths or continuous sequences of stormwater
        runoff. These models can also distinguish the methods used to route rainfall runoff towards
        inlet structures in urban conveyance networks or stormwater volume management measures.
        Models can also be described by different spatial detail such as lumped, semi-distributed or
        distributed inputs (<xref linkend="b4ch2_f_lsm3n"/>, <xref linkend="b4ch2_s_pfupn"/>).
        Lumped catchment models approximate the behaviour of the catchment using single average
        inputs and assumptions. Semi-distributed models employ a range of sub-catchments with
        different attributes and assumptions. In contrast, spatially explicit details are included
        in distributed models – this detail may include the range of different land uses and
        properties in an urban model or a grid of equal size and shape used throughout the model. An
        emerging type of distributed hydrology and hydraulic model is the direct rainfall or rain on
        grid methods (see <xref linkend="b6_ch4_s_9f1m8"/>). </para>
      <para>Empirical relationships can be utilised to determine peak flows from small catchments
        and are applied to the design of roof gutters, downpipes, and infrastructure to manage
        stormwater runoff from properties in accordance with standards such as AS/NZS 3500.3. These
        approximate methods include nominal “deemed to comply” infrastructure specifications or
        require information about catchment area and slope, and utilise assumed runoff coefficients,
        time of concentration and design rainfall intensity in a lumped catchment design process. </para>
      <para>The probabilistic or the urban Rational Method is a more detailed approximate method
        that is utilised to generate peak flow<?oxy_insert_start author="testoni" timestamp="20181112T135810+1100"?>
        <?oxy_insert_end?>rates for use in the design of pipe networks within small properties and
        for small sub-catchments. This framework of analysis differs from simple empirical
        relationships by including equivalent or effective impervious areas, accumulation of flow
        rates and the areas of different land uses. The method uses rainfall intensity derived from
        Intensity Frequency Duration (IFD) data, assumed runoff coefficients and time of
        concentration to derive stormwater peak flows. </para>
      <para>The design approach associated with urban Rational Method is often based on lumped
        sub-catchment inputs to inlet structures which require the resolution of partial area
        effects on the timing of cumulative peak discharges throughout a conveyance network. A
        lumped sub-catchment process combines all land uses, including the area of pervious and
        impervious surfaces (full area), with an estimated time of concentration to derive peak
        flows at the outlet of a sub-catchment which is the inlet to a conveyance network. A partial
        area effect is, for example, where the runoff from impervious surfaces (partial area)
        arrives at the outlet before runoff from pervious surfaces reach the outlet at less than the
        full area travel time. These methods may be used to analyse the capacity of individual pipes
        or peak flows from small catchments but cannot simulate actual flow behaviour throughout
        conveyance networks and urban stormwater management systems <citation>arr_1987</citation>. </para>
      <para>The simple nature of the urban Rational Method cannot account for the complexity of
        contemporary urban catchments and modern stormwater management approaches, the temporal and
        spatial variability of storm events, and variations in antecedent or between storm event
        processes. Approximate methods, such as Rational Method, should only be applied within a
        catchment where more detailed analysis of rainfall runoff observations have defined the
        parameters (such as runoff coefficient and time of concentration) for use in the method
          <citation>b8_c_r58,b2_c5_r40</citation>. However, <citation>b5_c3_r31+1</citation>
        established that derivation of runoff parameters at the regional scale or bottom of a
        catchment may not necessarily describe local processes in sub-catchments. Local information
        is also needed to determine urban runoff parameters. </para>
      <para>Runoff or hydrograph routing methods are commonly associated with computer models that
        include internal processes that incorporate different land uses with separate pervious and
        impervious surfaces. The process includes depression storages and losses with lag times to
        generate separate hydrographs of runoff for each land surface. These runoff routing methods
        typically employ event-based rainfall inputs (<xref linkend="b4_ch3_s_y3noq"/>) of selected
        Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) and duration of peak burst rainfall (see <xref
          linkend="b9_ch6_s_9307w"/>). An objective of this process is to achieve probability
        neutrality between rainfall inputs and generated runoff for urban catchments. </para>
      <para>These runoff routing methods may utilise single or multiple design storms and associated
        temporal patterns to determine regimes of excess rainfall that is then routed through
        hydraulic models that range from simple pipe hydraulics to full two-dimensional hydrodynamic
        processes. A key limitation of event-based modelling approaches is the need for assumptions
        about joint probability of antecedent conditions (such as soil moisture and available
        storage in volume management solutions) and the characteristics of storm events
          <citation>b9_c3_r16</citation>. In addition, event-based methods have traditionally only
        simulated runoff from burst rainfall and have not considered that runoff is also generated
        by pre-burst and post burst rainfall (see <xref linkend="b9_ch6_s_9307w"/>). The magnitude
        of rainfall runoff in urban catchment may be under-estimated by event-based processes unless
        pre-burst rainfall is also counted in rainfall event-based models. </para>
      <para>The limitations of rainfall event-based models, and dramatic increases in the capacity
        and utilisation of computers has fostered the use of continuous simulation (<xref
          linkend="b4_ch3_s_5wtrv"/>; <xref linkend="b9_ch3"/>) models that can account for
        continuous physical, conceptual and statistical processes in urban catchments. These methods
        have traditionally utilised real or synthetically generated rainfall sequences to understand
        the yield from water supply catchments and the behaviour of water and wastewater
        distribution networks. These methods are also used to estimate the behaviour of stormwater
        quality solutions in urban catchments <citation>b9_c6_r9</citation>. However, continuous
        simulation can also be employed to account for the interactions between climate processes,
        human interventions or behaviours and stormwater runoff from urban catchments
          <citation>b9_c4_r173</citation>. Pluviograph rainfall records with intervals of less than
        an hour (often 6-minute intervals) are used in continuous simulation of rainfall runoff from
        urban catchments. </para>
      <para>The continuous simulation method involves simulation of a rainfall runoff model over a
        time period of sufficient length to account for all of the important interactions between
        rainfall and catchment processes to produce an urban flood frequency analysis. Sufficient
        lengths of observed rainfall are usually not available to provide adequate information about
        rare runoff events and synthetic rainfall sequences are often required for continuous
        simulation models (<xref linkend="b4_ch3_s_6xe8d"/>; <xref linkend="b2_ch6"/>, ). Use of
        continuous simulation with synthetic rainfall inputs may require calibration of the rainfall
        model and the continuous runoff routing model (<xref linkend="b4_ch3_s_77dp8"/>). However,
        all models require calibration and verification. </para>
      <para>An alternative use of continuous simulation is to derive the probability distribution of
        initial conditions prior to storm events such soil moisture storage, and available storage
        in rainwater tanks and bioretention facilities <citation>b9_c3_r8,b9_c2_r31</citation>.
        These probability distributions of initial conditions are then utilised in event-based
        runoff routing models to determine runoff from urban catchments. Note that these types of
        probabilistic inputs are associated with complete storm events and will need to be applied
        in event-based models using complete storm events or combinations of pre-burst and burst
        rainfall. </para>
      <para>Direct rainfall or rain on grid models combine hydrological and hydraulic processes to
        generate rainfall runoff and hydraulic routing in a single model. Rainfall is applied to
        each grid in a two-dimensional hydraulic model to generate overland flows and discharges in
        conduits (<xref linkend="b6_ch4_s_9f1m8"/>). This method can provide more realistic
        representation of catchment storages and surface runoff processes including cross catchment
        flows. A fine grid of good quality topographic, losses and roughness data is required, and
        topography information will need to be edited to include key infrastructure such as street
        gutters, hydraulic structure, conveyance networks and road crowns
          <citation>b9_c6_r21</citation>. Rain on grid models should be calibrated to local
        historical spatial flood levels or flow data. Use of regional rainfall runoff parameters is
        not suitable for direct rainfall methods that are driven by local processes. </para>
      <para>There may also be a need to vary roughness parameters (such as Mannings n) with flow
        depth (for example,: <citation>b9_c6_r20+1</citation>; <citation>b9_c6_r12+1</citation>;
          <citation>b9_c6_r13+1</citation>) and carefully assign loss parameters in each grid
          <citation>b4_c2_r2</citation>. The results at local and sub-catchment scales may be
        unexpected as all flow paths are identified. The method is subject to a range of potential
        challenges including mathematical instabilities, unrealistic flows and large errors created
        by losses, variable roughness, long runtime and shallow flow depths. These powerful direct
        rain methods are subject to ongoing research and model results should be interpreted with
        caution. It is imperative that<?oxy_insert_start author="testoni" timestamp="20181112T173609+1100"?>

        check that catchment response with an alternative model and volume of runoff is consistent
        with loss model used (see <xref linkend="b9_ch6_s_4i8gc"/>). If a rainfall excess model is
        used this represents the volume of runoff that appears at the catchment outlet not rainfall
        applied to the model so depression storage needs to factored into losses. </para>

      <title>Choice of Rainfall</title>
      <para>Most hydrology and hydraulic models require rainfall inputs to estimate stormwater
        runoff and associated flood responses. The investigations underpinning the 2016 version of
        Australian Rainfall and Runoff incorporated 30 years of additional data and science (<xref
          linkend="b2_ch1"/>) to develop improved design rainfall frameworks. There was also a need
        to incorporate climate change processes into design rainfall frameworks (<xref
          linkend="b2_ch2_s_3"/>). Design rainfalls are simpler and different to real or observed
        rainfall. More advanced design rainfalls that assume storm bursts and spatial uniform
        temporal patterns cannot capture that actual variability of observed rainfall. This insight
        motivated a change in practice from simple average rainfall intensity or single rainfall
        burst approaches to ensemble and Monte Carlo methods to better capture the natural
        variability of rainfall. </para>
      <para>The design of stormwater infrastructure and understanding of runoff for urban areas
        involves decisions at multiple scales. This insight can be combined with ensembles of design
        rainfall patterns to determine the appropriate rainfall inputs as shown (for example,) by
        the Box and Whisker plot of peak runoff (discharge) to the catchment outlet in <xref

        A small number of higher values of peak runoff also occur in the 45-minute (maximum value)
        and 120-minute (far outlier value) durations which could be used to test the potential
        maximum hazard of surface flows. Conveyance infrastructure within the catchment should be
        designed using ensembles of storms with durations up to and including 25-minute to account
        for impacts of smaller duration storms upstream of the outlet. Different design ensembles
        may apply in situations that incorporate within catchment storage solutions and at different
        locations in the urban catchment.</para>
      <para>This improved approach to design rainfall inputs to models is particularly important for
        urban catchments that are significantly different to rural catchments because they generate
        runoff from majority of rainfall as shown in <xref linkend="b9_ch6_f_bo594"/>. </para>

        rainfall events that should be considered in analysis of urban hydrology. Urban designs
        based on a single burst pattern of rainfall or peak rainfall assumptions can overlook
        substantial runoff rates and volumes which may adversely impact on the performance of inlet

      <para><xref linkend="b9_ch6_f_4txi2"/> demonstrates the pathways of stormwater runoff from
        different surfaces within a property. These runoff processes are dominated by directly
        connected impervious surfaces, indirectly connected surfaces and pervious surfaces. Rain
        falling on impervious roof surfaces flow into roof gutter storages which discharge via
        downpipes into pipes connected to the street gutter or pipe network. Runoff from impervious
        driveway surfaces and adjacent road surfaces discharge to street gutters. These impervious
        surfaces facilitate highly efficient translation of rainfall into runoff, are subject to
        small depression storage losses, and are mostly directly connected to street gutters. Rain
        falling on pervious yard areas is partially retained in depression storages and infiltrates
        into soil profiles prior to generation of runoff from residual rainfall. These types of
        pervious surfaces are relatively inefficient at generating runoff and are often indirectly
        connected to street gutters or pipe networks. Urban properties can also include impervious
        areas that discharge stormwater to pervious surfaces or storages (for example; rainwater
        tanks, onsite detention and raingardens) that partially disconnect these surfaces from
        street gutters. </para>
      <para>Runoff from impervious surfaces may also arrive at street gutters more rapidly than
        runoff from pervious surfaces. In many situations, pervious surfaces may not generate runoff
        for frequent rainfall events. These runoff behaviours are influenced by the configuration of
        property assets (including building form), topography and stormwater management measures. In
        situations where allotments slope away from roads, runoff from roofs and impervious surfaces
        may be directed to an inter-allotment conveyance (easement drainage) network. Local
        authorities will often specify locations of stormwater discharges from properties – this is
        known as a legal discharge point. Subsoil drains are sometimes used on properties to lower
        water tables around buildings or in waterlogged areas and discharge stormwater from
        properties. </para>
      <para>Property scale influences are fundamental to urban stormwater runoff. However, there has
        been limited testing at this scale <citation>b9_c6_r17</citation>, and designs of roof and
        property drainage are not clearly defined <citation>b9_c6_r11</citation>. A major challenge
        for simulation of urban stormwater runoff is the behaviour of individual properties and
        accumulation of these property behaviours throughout urban catchments
          (<citation>b5_c3_r31,b9_c5_r2</citation>; <xref linkend="b9_ch3"/>). The cumulative
        impacts of properties on the behaviour of catchments are defined by the timing, volume and
        rate of stormwater runoff from each property. The runoff behaviour of properties can also be
        altered by a range of onsite stormwater management approaches including disconnection of
        roof downpipes from street gutters, raingardens, landscaping, rainwater tanks, infiltration
        measures, onsite detention and green spaces (See <xref linkend="b9_ch3"/> and <xref
          linkend="b9_ch4"/>). Local authorities can apply restrictions on the flow<?oxy_insert_start author="testoni" timestamp="20181112T135813+1100"?>

        detail in stormwater design is required to ensure that potentially overlooked local
        processes do not generate local failures or excessive infrastructure or unexpected
        downstream consequences. The problems generated by approximated local behaviours can become
        worse in areas subject to increasing urban density and infill development.
          <citation>b9_c6_r10+1</citation>, for example, found that increases in urban density of
        18% generated 16% increase in runoff volumes and a 300% increase in expected flood damages

        conveyance network. The performance of these networks may be affected by in-pipe attenuation
        effects, volume management measures, and substantial variations in the timing and magnitude
        of runoff to sub-catchment outlets. These outflows from properties are surface flows, or
        direct inflows to pipe networks in streets or inter-allotment conveyance networks.</para>
      <para>Approximate or general design methods are based in rules derived from simple Rational

        A five-minute time of concentration and associated rainfall intensity was commonly assumed
        in design processes for roof and property drainage. Performance standards for roofs have
        been defined by choice of rainfall intensity of a 5% AEP for roof gutters and of a 1% AEP
        for box gutters. Design of conveyance networks within properties aim to avoid surcharges and
        overland flows for 1 EY in low density areas and up to 5% AEP for important land uses (such
        as hospitals and aged care facilities) that may be vulnerable to greater risk or

        burst rainfall patterns will assist with defining the likely magnitude of overland flow
        behaviours at the property. Initial losses in the analysis may need to be set to zero if the
        magnitude of pre-burst rainfall is greater than the capacity of depression storages on the

        inlet structure (see <xref linkend="b5_ch2_s_002"/> and <xref linkend="b9_ch5_s_wtcce"/>).
        For example, a sub-catchment area of 4,250 m<superscript>2</superscript> with an impervious
        proportion of 56% and time of concentration which depends on rainfall intensity, slope and

      <para>Impervious or pervious surfaces can be directly connected or disconnected to inlet
        structures in conveyance networks. These surfaces may be also distant from the inlet
        structure or near the inlet. Thus the level of connectedness and distance of impervious
        areas from inlet structures should also be considered in analysis of stormwater runoff in
        urban areas. In addition, the analysis should account for surfaces that discharge to inlets
        via rapid conveyance mechanisms, such as street gutters, and for other surfaces that may
        discharge to inlets via slower conveyance processes such as across pervious surfaces (green
        spaces) or via storages. </para>
      <para>An urban sub-catchment often includes depression storages, and a mosaic of different

        change travel times and peak flows. Roofs may discharge via pipes to street gutters that
        facilitate rapid transfer of runoff volume to inlets. Runoff from road surfaces to the

      <para>Urban sub-catchments include directly connected impervious areas (DCIA), indirectly
        connected impervious areas (IDCIA) and pervious areas as described in <xref
          linkend="b5_ch5_s_ppgv2"/>. Limited regional investigations suggest that a combination of
        these effects produced effective impervious areas (EIA) which are 55% - 65% of the TIA of
        urban sub-catchments. Estimates of indirectly connected areas are further impacted by
        interactions between impervious and pervious areas, by storage in sub-catchments with Water
        Sensitive Urban Design (WSUD) measures and are influenced by antecedent soil moisture
        conditions (AMC). </para>
      <para>Other impervious surfaces may discharge via driveways to the street gutter which
        produces a different time for stormwater runoff to reach the inlet structure. Pervious
        surfaces also discharge to the street gutter, partially via impervious surfaces, to the
        inlet. Thus the timing of the arrival of runoff volumes to the inlet is dependent on these
        many different configurations and characteristics within the sub-catchment. So the
        performance of the inlet structure and the magnitude of surface bypass flows are
        dramatically affected by these considerations. These complex processes can be better
        described by semi-distributed (link-node) and distributed (grid) computer models (<xref
          linkend="b5_ch2_s_009"/>; <xref linkend="b6_ch4_s_v3f40"/>) that explicitly combine these
        details with pre-burst rainfall and ensembles on burst rainfall patterns. </para>
      <para>Regional analysis of a small number of urban catchments provides estimated initial
        losses of 1 – 3 mm for EIA and 20 – 30 mm for indirectly connected areas in sub-catchments
          (<xref linkend="b5_ch5_s_dewgv"/>). Estimated median continuing losses were 2.5 mm/hour in
        South East Australia and 1 – 4 mm/hour elsewhere. These event-based regional values should
        only be used in the absence of local data. It is essential that assumptions about losses in
        stormwater models are based on assessment of local conditions. The magnitude of losses is
        also impacted by antecedent moisture conditions (AMC) which is altered by garden watering in
        urban areas and by available storage in volume management measures throughout the
        sub-catchment. It is unlikely that event-based models can fully account for these effects.
        Sensitivity checks, Monte Carlo processes and continuous simulation can be utilised to
        include the variation in AMC and available storage within urban sub-catchments. </para>
      <para>Urban drainage was historically designed using peak flows derived using peak rainfall
        intensity or peak rainfall bursts in accordance with the assumption that peak flow<?oxy_insert_start author="testoni" timestamp="20181112T135759+1100"?>
        <?oxy_insert_end?>rates only affect conveyance infrastructure. Many urban drainage networks
        are operating below anticipated service levels due to a range of impacts including increased
        density of urban areas. Analysis by <citation>b2_c5_r40+1</citation> indicates that the
        absence of stormwater runoff volumes in design processes based on peak runoff assumptions
        may partially explain under-performance of some urban drainage networks. The performance of
        inlet structures and therefore drainage networks can also be affected by the volume of
        stormwater arriving at the structure, variations in rainfall temporal patterns and by
        pre-burst rainfall that was not included in the design process. The uncounted volumes of
        stormwater runoff in peak flow and storm burst assumptions can become additional and
        unexpected overland or bypass flows in urban systems. </para>

      <title>From the Inlet to the Outlet</title>
      <para>Rainfall runoff from sub-catchments accumulates as inflows to conveyance networks or as
        surface flows throughout urban catchments that discharge towards an outlet (<xref
          linkend="b9_ch5"/>). A network of conveyance infrastructure may incorporate pipes, open
        channels, roadways and open space. These networks often include water quality, volume
        management and flow control infrastructure (see <xref linkend="b9_ch4"/>) that are
        incorporated in sub-catchment scale processes (such as source and neighbourhood controls:
        see <xref linkend="b9_ch5_f_s4eek"/>) or as regional controls at the outlet.</para>
      <para>Analysis and design of stormwater management and flooding in urban areas was
        historically based on separate hydrology and hydraulic processes, and is focused at the
        network scale. A key objective of these processes was determination of flows in conveyance
        infrastructure such as pipes and open channels to avoid surcharges and bypass flows at
        inlets (see <xref linkend="b9_ch5_s_wtcce"/>) to avoid nuisance, property damage and risk to
        life (see <xref linkend="b9_ch5_s_j339y"/> and <xref linkend="b9_ch8"/>). These urban
        conveyance networks include significant surface flows, usually along roads and through open
        spaces, from sub-catchments into and throughout conveyance networks. These flows from
        sub-catchments to inlets and within conveyance networks were determined as a hydrological
        process as an input to hydraulic models of conveyance networks (see <xref
          linkend="b9_ch5_s_iy2cb"/>and <xref linkend="b5_ch2"/>).</para>
      <para>The conveyance network is a framework of sub-catchment inputs. Urban stormwater design
        typically employed pipe network hydraulic models that utilise peak inflows or hydrographs as
        inputs (see <xref linkend="b9_ch5_f_bfuec"/>). More advanced one-dimensional models were
        also available that can be applied to simulation of conveyance networks (see <xref
          linkend="b6_ch4_s_utkoe"/>; <xref linkend="b5_ch6"/> and <xref linkend="b9_ch5"/>). </para>
      <para>Overland or surface flows are a key consideration in analysis and design of urban
        stormwater management infrastructure. The dominant urban hydraulic response to rare rainfall
        events (such as 1% AEP) is often overland flows on roads and across open space. Emerging
        methods of analysis and design of urban stormwater involve combined hydrology and hydraulic
        models to better understand surface flows throughout urban catchments. These methods include
        coupled one and two-dimensional models, and direct rainfall (rain on grid) models. <xref
          linkend="b6_ch4_s_v3f40"/>, and <citation>b4_c2_r2+1</citation> provide detailed
        discussion about these approaches. </para>
      <para>The flow<?oxy_insert_start author="testoni" timestamp="20181112T135803+1100"?>
        <?oxy_insert_end?>rates, depth and area of surface flows in urban catchments are highly
        sensitive to different temporal patterns and volumes of rainfall
          <citation>b4_c2_r2</citation>. Similarly, <citation>b9_c3_r54+1</citation>,
          <citation>b5_c3_r31+1</citation> and <citation>b2_c5_r40+1</citation> found that the
        performance of conveyance infrastructure also varies with temporal patterns and volumes of
        rainfall. It is recommended that ensembles of ten temporal patterns of design rainfall are
        used for investigation of the hydrology and hydraulic processes in urban areas. The
        separation of hydrologic and hydraulic routing is often blurred in analysis of urban areas
        which fosters complicated decisions around the use of hydrologic inputs and their
        interaction with hydraulic models. An overview of the difference approaches to rainfall
        inputs provided by ARR 2016 is compared to ARR 1987 approach in <xref

        modelling as required for different design and assessment tasks (see <xref linkend="b2_ch4"
        /> for further detail). The rapid assessment approach is not recommended for design of urban
        conveyance networks and the Monte Carlo processes can be used in special cases. It is
        expected that rainfall ensembles in hydrologic simulations, and in hydrologic and hydraulic
        simulations would be commonly utilised in urban conveyance networks. The process of using
        rainfall ensembles in hydrology is outlined in <xref linkend="b9_ch6_f_d4u19"/>. </para>
      <para><xref linkend="b9_ch6_f_d4u19"/> shows that the inputs to analysis of the conveyance
        network include Intensity Frequency Duration (IFD) information from the BOM, ensembles of
        rainfall temporal patterns, regional losses, pre-burst rainfall and Areal reduction factors
        from the ARR 2016 Data Hub. Wherever possible, local losses derived in accordance with <xref
          linkend="b9_ch6_s_rhstb"/>and <xref linkend="b9_ch6_s_4i8gc"/> should be used in
        preference to regional losses for urban areas. These inputs are used in a hydrology model to
        generate ensembles of peak flows throughout the urban catchment for various storm durations
        and the required quantiles or AEPs of storm events Mean peak flows are derived for key
        locations in the catchment and the rainfall temporal pattern that produces peak flows
        closest to the mean peak flows are utilised in the hydraulic model. This approach may be
        better suited to models with longer run times as considerable time can be expended
        determining critical durations in both hydrology and hydraulic models. </para>

        Use of coupled 1D/2D and direct rain models were necessary to understand within catchment
        surface flows and flooding. The potentially short model run times and need to understand
        local flooding supports use of rainfall ensembles in both hydrology and hydraulics models.

        traditional methods by examination of the characteristics of hydrograph produced by both

      <para><xref linkend="b9_ch6_f_mb2m4"/> demonstrates that a single pattern of burst rainfall
        from ARR 1987 produces a different hydrograph shape, volume and peak runoff at the catchment
        outlet to the ensemble of storm burst patterns from ARR 2016. This difference is driven by
        the 30 years of additional data and science available to ARR 2016 that has allowed the
        derivations of more spatially relevant rainfall and temporal patterns. The variability of
        the equally likely storm burst patterns from the ARR 2016 ensembles facilitates testing of
        catchment characteristics for generation of maximum runoff. </para>
      <para>The direct rainfall method applies rainfall directly to all grid cells and the scale of
        routing is at every 2 m by 2 m grid cell. In this approach the depth of flow is shallow and
        rainfall can get stuck on the model grid. To maintain the area of rainfall applied to the
        grid, the buildings were nulled (removed) from the actual grid and rainfall was scaled up to
        account for the lost building areas. </para>
      <para>The concentrated direct rainfall method applied rainfall to polygons of different local
        surfaces such as buildings and parks. This process permits the specification of the area,
        initial and continuing losses that are applied to each land use polygon. Separate attributes
        are applied to roofs to account for the different connectivity to concentrated stormwater

        catchment. Flows extracted from the hydraulic model 1D results can also be converted into
        volumes. A flow line along the upstream catchment divide together with outflow boundaries
        were used in the 2D hydraulic model to also account for the volume of overland flows leaving
        the catchment. These results can be presented as a cumulative depth graph or as a pie chart

      <para><xref linkend="b9_ch6_f_7eekx"/> demonstrates that the uncorrected direct rainfall
        models produce variable under-estimation of surface flows, as compared to a traditional
        coupled 1D/2D model, that is dependent on location and attributes of sub-catchments.
        Techniques that account for depression storage or pre-wetting of the catchment surfaces
        using restart files can improve the comparative performance of direct rain models. However,
        the residual differences in surface flows highlight that 2D models and in particular direct
        rainfall models should also be verified using historical records of local flood depths.
        Surface flows are a significant proportion of the responses from urban catchment as shown in

      <para>This case study demonstrates practical application of the ARR 2016 ensemble temporal
        patterns on an urban catchment that is dominated by overland flow. The pattern that best
        represents the mean response has been selected based on flood elevation rather than flow. It
        is clear from the results of this analysis that a volume check of direct rainfall approaches
        should be undertaken in accordance with recommendations of <citation>b4_c2_r2+1</citation>
        and the results should be verified using historical records of spatial flooding. A
        significant amount the rainfall excess is not generating runoff because rainfall is trapped
        on the terrain grid. This trapped rainfall excess represents an effective overestimation of
        the catchment loses with associated underestimation of surface flow and should be factored
        into the losses so that the correct amount of rainfall excess is generated. This can be
        carried out by either pre-wetting parts of the catchment or adjusting the assumed initial
        losses or a combination of both.</para>

        estimate local rural losses that were calibrated to rural flows sourced from the RFFE as
        shown in <xref linkend="b9_ch6_f_zcahc"/>. The critical duration was found to be 1.5 hours
        as defined by highest mean peak flows for 50%, 10% and 1% AEP events as shown in <xref
          linkend="b9_ch6_f_jxn9x"/>, <xref linkend="b9_ch6_f_3c9mh"/> and <xref

        also selected from the ARR Data Hub for 50% AEP: 4.1 mm; 10% AEP: 3.3 mm and 1% AEP: 1.1 mm.
        The pre-burst rainfall was included in the hydrology model and spread over the hour prior to
        burst rainfall and the calibration processes aimed to find values of IL and CL that produced
        simulated rural peak flows that were similar to RFFE peak flows for the 10% AEP events. This
        process enabled an estimate of local rural initial losses of 16 mm and continuing loss of 5
        mm/hr for an assumed Mannings roughness coefficient (n = 0.075).</para>

      <para><xref linkend="b9_ch6_f_6zky4"/> to <xref linkend="b9_ch6_f_367go"/> show that the mean
        peak flows from the basin were less than the rural flows with critical durations ranging
        from one to three hours. A one hour critical duration of peak water levels in the basin was
        also observed from the analysis (see <xref linkend="b9_ch6_f_fy6ha"/>). These result
        highlight that critical durations of stormwater runoff can vary throughout catchments and
        across different types of the infrastructure. </para>
      <para>The design of the conveyance and storage infrastructure was evaluated for climate change
        impacts using the methods outlined in <xref linkend="b1_ch6"/> and <xref
          linkend="b8_s_8n655"/>. A design life for the infrastructure and consequence level for
        climate change impacts was selected. A design life of 100 years was assumed for the basin
        with medium consequences of failure due to impacts on the waterway and surrounding rural
        properties.</para>
      <para>This assessment was utilised to extract data from ARR 2016 Data Hub for the RCP 8.5
        value for 2090 which indicated an expected 16.1% increase in peak rainfall. This expected
        increase in peak flows was used to alter the relevant design rainfall ensembles and the
        hydrology/hydraulic model was rerun to test the impact of climate change on peak water
        levels in the basin and on roads. Designers should also utilise emerging research to
        incorporate that most up to date climate change assessments. For example,
          <citation>b1_c6_r5+1</citation> outline greater potential for increased rainfall
        intensities in urban areas. </para>
      <para>The impact of applying the expected 2090 climate change effects on design rainfall on
        peak water levels in the basin and at a critical location on the road is shown in <xref
          linkend="b9_ch6_f_9lvvw"/>. Increases in peak water depths are experienced in the basin
        and on the road. The increased runoff into the basin is managed by the emergency spillway
        and peak water levels are acceptable. However, peak water levels on the road exceed the
        design objectives and the designer should highlight this situation to the consent authority
        for further consideration.</para>
