    <title>Flood Hydrograph Modelling</title>
    <para>From the alternative flood estimation approaches introduced in <xref linkend="b1_ch3"/>,
      the methods and models covered in this book of Australian Rainfall and Runoff focus on the
        <emphasis role="italic">event-based simulation </emphasis>approach. On the background of the
      more general aspects of catchment simulation for design flood estimation covered in <xref
        linkend="book4"/>, the chapters in this book deal specifically with the models and design
      inputs required to transform the design rainfall inputs from <xref linkend="book2"/> into
      design flood hydrographs at catchment locations of interest. </para>
    <para>The models typically applied in the event-based simulation approach are distributed in
      nature; they represent the catchment being modelled by a number of sub-catchments or subareas;
      the degree of spatial resolution of models may vary from around 10 subareas to hundreds or
      thousands of grid cells. The flood producing processes are divided into a <emphasis
        role="italic">runoff generation phase</emphasis>, modelled at the sub-catchment or subarea
      scale, and a <emphasis role="italic">hydrograph formation phase</emphasis>, in which the
      hydrograph contributions from the subareas are routed along the different stream reaches and
      storages in the catchment to the point of interest. Node-link type runoff routing models are
      the most common form of these models, where the nodes represent the subareas and the links the
      routing reaches.</para>
    <para>The hydrologic processes involved in the runoff generation phase, described in more detail
      in <xref linkend="b4_ch2"/>, are represented in a highly conceptualised form as <emphasis
        role="italic">loss models</emphasis>, which divide the rainfall inputs into rainfall excess
      and loss (without modelling what happens with the loss component). As the name implies, the
      rainfall excess reflects only the surface runoff component that is directly attributable to
      the event rainfall. The additional component of streamflow originating from recession flows of
      previous rainfall events or groundwater inflows is referred to as baseflow. This baseflow
      component is represented in conceptual <emphasis role="italic">baseflow models</emphasis> and
      added to the rainfall excess component either at the sub-catchment scale or, more commonly, as
      a total baseflow hydrograph at the catchment outlet.</para>
    <para>In the hydrograph formation phase, the routing of flood contributions from subareas
      through the various stream reaches, floodplains and natural or artificial storages is modelled
      by hydrologic or hydraulic routing models of different complexity.</para>

    <title>Scope</title>
    <para>This book of Australian Rainfall and Runoff provides background information on the most
      common models currently used for flood hydrograph estimation, and the derivation of design
      inputs used with these models. It also provides guidance on how these models and design inputs
      can be applied for flood hydrograph estimation in rural and urban catchments located in
      different parts of Australia.</para>
    <para>As in other books, the guidance provided here should not be interpreted as being
      prescriptive, as unusual catchment conditions may require special considerations. Importantly,
      the application of the models and design data for flood hydrograph estimation should be guided
      by a good understanding of relevant catchment hydrology concepts.</para>

    <title>Book Contents</title>
    <para>This introductory chapter is followed by a chapter that introduces basic modelling
      concepts applied in event-based simulation of flood hydrographs and the components of a range
      of currently used modelling systems. The next two chapters then give details of the baseflow
      models and loss models applied in flood hydrograph estimation. Both chapters are based on
      research undertaken as part of the AR&amp;R Revision Projects funded by the Federal Department
      of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency. They first give the background to the selection of
      the adopted models, then describe the sources of information for the derivation of design
      values of baseflow and losses, and finally provide guidance for the practical application of
      baseflow models and loss models.</para>
