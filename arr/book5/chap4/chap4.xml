        <title>INTRODUCTION</title>
        
        <para>Streamflow is made up of two main conceptual components which are
            categorised using the catchment response following a rainfall event. Water
            that enters a stream rapidly is termed “quickflow” or “direct runoff” and
            is sourced from short-term storages within the catchment; these short-term
            storages form the catchment storage through which the runoff flows while
            travelling to the catchment outlet. Water that takes longer to reach a
            river is termed “baseflow” and is sourced primarily from depletion of
            long-term storages within the catchment; typically, water in these
            long-term storages is held as soil moisture or as groundwater. At any
            instance in time, different locations will have varying magnitudes of
            baseflow contribution to the streamflow due to differing regional
            hydrogeological conditions and antecedent conditions.</para>
        
        <para>A baseflow hydrograph as described by Nathan and McMahon (1990) and
            Brodie and Hostetler (2005) is considered to have the following
            features:</para>
        
        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>The flow before the start of a flood event generally is assumed
                    to consist entirely of baseflow. In other words, during the initial
                    periods of a runoff event, the flow is considered to consist entirely
                    of baseflow.</para>

            <listitem>
                <para>The rapid rise of the streamflow during a rainfall event
                    increases the volume of water held as bank storage. This water returns
                    to the main streamflow after a delay and creates a baseflow peak after
                    the main flood peak.</para>

        <para>As discussed earlier in <xref linkend="book1"/><!--Book 1 of Australian Rainfall and Runoff and
                                                              by Ball <emphasis>et al.</emphasis> (2011)-->, a common approach to
            generation of the data necessary for prediction of design flood
            characteristics is the use of catchment modelling systems. These catchment
            modelling systems focus on the simulation of those processes influencing
            “<emphasis>direct runoff</emphasis>” and the baseflow component of
            streamflow either is ignored or is incorporated after the direct runoff
            has been estimated. It is the later approach that is the focus herein,
            namely the estimation of the baseflow hydrograph for addition to the
            direct runoff hydrograph after the direct runoff hydrograph has been
            predicted.</para>

        <title>BASEFLOW CHARACTERISTICS</title>
        
        <para>For design flood estimation in Australia, baseflow has typically
            been considered to be a relatively minor contributor, but can potentially
            be significant in more frequent events. This is particularly the case
            where the catchment geology consists of high yielding aquifers with high
            levels of baseflow.</para>
        
        <para>In the context of design flood estimation, a surface runoff
            hydrograph will typically be generated that excludes baseflow. It is
            necessary to estimate the baseflow contribution in order to completely
            represent the total event peak and volume, and to generate a total
            streamflow hydrograph. This concept is represented in <xref linkend="figure_28340800"/>. This
            document provides a technique for quantifying baseflow contribution to
            design flood estimates.</para>
        
        <para>To support this, it is relevant to identify a number of features of
            an event hydrograph, shown in <xref linkend="figure_28340800"/>:</para>

            <title>Preliminary assessment of baseflow</title>
            
            <para>A preliminary assessment should be undertaken to consider whether
                baseflow is likely to be a significant component of the design flood
                hydrograph. A detailed analysis task is not suggested at this point.
                Instead, this assessment is intended to be a coarse screening test to
                help determine the most appropriate approach to estimate baseflow for
                the catchment of interest based on local baseflow characteristics. A
                number of tools are available to support this assessment:</para>
            
            <itemizedlist>
                <listitem>
                    <para><xref linkend="figure_15142923"/> is provided to readily identify the relative
                        magnitude of baseflow compared to surface runoff for catchments
                        across Australia. Practitioners can identify their catchment of
                        interest within this data set and note the value of the Baseflow
                        Peak Factor. This map shows catchments to match with the screening
                        criteria identified below, while <xref linkend="figure_85594555"/> and <xref linkend="figure_05634839"/> (and
                        associated spatial data) provide a more detailed estimate of
                        baseflow.</para>

                <listitem>
                    <para>If available, streamflow data for the catchment should be
                        reviewed. The magnitude of low flows relative to peaks can be used
                        to determine whether baseflow is likely to be an important component
                        of the flood hydrograph.</para>

            </itemizedlist>
            
            <para>Where baseflow is a small component compared to the surface
                runoff, the design flood peak can simply be adjusted by up to 5% to make
                an allowance for baseflow. This approach is considered relevant for
                catchments where baseflow is estimated to represent less than
                approximately 5% of the surface runoff for a flood event. Catchments
                with a Baseflow Peak Factor less than 0.05 are considered suitable for
                this approach. This reflects approximately 30% of the catchments mapped
                in <xref linkend="figure_15142923"/>.</para>
            
            <para>It is suggested that catchments that have a baseflow contribution
                greater than approximately 5% of the surface runoff should explicitly
                incorporate the baseflow component into the design flood using a more
                rigorous approach.</para>
            
            <para>Where baseflow is a very large component of the event (a
                contribution of more than 30% is suggested, reflected by a Baseflow Peak
                Factor greater than 0.3), it is considered important that baseflow is
                considered based on site-specific analyses using techniques that are
                suited to the nature and availability of local data (e.g. see Brodie and
                Hostetler, 2005; Chapman and Maxwell, 1996; Nathan and McMahon, 1990).
                Catchments located in tropical north Australia, south-west Western
                Australia and the south east coastline of South Australia may fall into
                this category.</para>
            
            <para>Where baseflow is between approximately 5% and 30% of the surface
                runoff (Baseflow Peak Factor between 0.05 and 0.3), the approach
                outlined below is recommended. This relates to approximately 75% of the
                catchments mapped in <xref linkend="figure_15142923"/>.</para>

            <title>Suitability of stream flow data</title>
            
            <para>Where possible, recorded streamflow data should be used directly
                to quantify baseflow. However, ideally more than 10 years of continuous
                streamflow data would be required to undertake detailed site-specific
                analyses. Appropriate data quality checks should be undertaken prior to
                ascertaining the period of record available for analysis. Preferably,
                the streamflow data should extend over a period of record that enables
                the identification of an event of similar magnitude to the design flood
                of interest.</para>
            
            <para>In addition, there are various activities that can affect
                streamflows and interfere with the flow characteristics usually

            <para>A regional method to estimate baseflow contribution to design
                flood events has been developed that is applicable for unregulated

                across Australia with catchment areas between 7 and 7800

            <para>This approach can be directly applied to estimate the baseflow

                This approach is consistent with the logic that baseflow is only a small
                proportion of the total surface runoff for rare and extreme

            <para>The characteristics of the surface runoff, baseflow and total
                streamflow can be used to estimate the hydrograph for the event. For
                simplicity, a linear approach can typically be used to estimate the
                baseflow at each time step, by fitting between the data values estimated
                through the process described above and matching the baseflow volume.
                This time series can be manually added to the surface runoff time series
                data to generate a time series for the total streamflow. The time series
                generated through this process should be reviewed, and may require
                smoothing to produce a more realistic temporal distribution of baseflow.

        <para>Analyses undertaken to develop most of the method outlined in
            <xref linkend="section_75228116"/> is described in detail in separate technical documents,
            available online at the ARR update website (SKM, 2010, available online
            http://www.arr.org.au/p7.html). However, the background behind the
            calculation of the timing of the baseflow peak is not captured in those
            documents. A full description of the development of <xref linkend="equation_56532397"/> is provided
            below. The description below assumes that the reader has an understanding
            of the work presented in the separate technical documents, and a full
            background of the broader study concepts is not provided here.</para>
        
        <para>More than 230 suitable catchments across Australia were identified
            for analysis for ARR Update Project 7, and hourly streamflow data was
            collated for each of these locations. A baseflow time series was generated
            from each flow record using the Lyne and Hollick digital filter, modified
            to suit hourly streamflow data. The top 4N flood events were identified in
            the hourly time series data for each catchment, generating a data set of
            more than 30,000 flood events across the 236 catchments. For each of these
            events, the magnitude and timing of the total streamflow peak and baseflow
            peak were identified. The time to these peaks was calculated from the
            start of the event. At each location, the average time to the streamflow
            and baseflow peaks were then calculated based on the 4N events.</para>
        
        <para>For the purposes of this assessment, it was assumed that the total
            streamflow and surface runoff peaks would coincide. This is considered a
            reasonable assumption since surface runoff is generally the main component
            of the total streamflow hydrograph.</para>
        
        <para>Analysis of the average time to peak data identified a strong
            relationship between the time to the surface runoff (and streamflow) and
            baseflow peaks, as presented in <xref linkend="figure_74876507"/>. This relationship provides a
            direct calculation from which to estimate the timing of the baseflow peak,
            based upon knowledge of the surface runoff event generated using a flood
            event model. That is, the time to the baseflow peak (in hours from the
            start of the event) can be calculated as:</para>
