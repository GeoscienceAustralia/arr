    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>This chapter deals with a range of approaches available to calculate design flood
      hydrographs at the catchment outlet and other points of interest. It therefore integrates the
      previous chapters in <xref linkend="book5"/> and also links to <xref linkend="book7"/>, where
      practical applications are discussed.</para>
    <para>The time-area approaches (<xref linkend="b5_ch6_s_ypsrh"/>) and unit hydrograph approaches
        (<xref linkend="b5_ch6_s_7b1zz"/>) allow a relatively simple transformation of rainfall
      excess inputs to flood hydrograph outputs and are directly applicable to a lumped
      representation of the flood formation process in a catchment, where the inputs and processes
      can be assumed to be spatially uniform (or at least spatially consistent between different
      events). These “traditional” approaches have generally been replaced by more flexible
      approaches. However, they also find application to represent the overland flow phase of
      hydrograph formation in some of the node-link type models discussed in subsequent sections. </para>
    <para>The most widely used flood hydrograph estimation models are based on the runoff routing
      approach, in which both the runoff production and hydrograph formation phases can be
      represented in a distributed fashion, reflecting the spatial variation of rainfall inputs and
      flood processes in a catchment. The two principal groups of models are the network (node-link
      type) models described in <xref linkend="b5_ch6_s_do8jr"/> and the rainfall-on-grid (or direct
      rainfall) models described in <xref linkend="b5_ch6_s_lgabf"/>. </para>
    <para>The routing methods incorporated in these models have their foundations in the open
      channel hydraulics introduced in <xref linkend="book6"/> and apply the flood routing
      principles outlined in <xref linkend="b5_ch3"/> of this book. The descriptions in <xref
        linkend="b5_ch6_s_do8jr"/> and <xref linkend="b5_ch6_s_lgabf"/> focus on the specific way
      these principles are applied to represent different parts of the flood hydrograph formation
      process.</para>
    <para>The discussion of flood hydrograph modelling in this chapter is intended to introduce
      readers to the different approaches used and the assumptions made in different modelling
      approaches and different runoff routing modelling systems. Guidance on the practical
      application of flood hydrograph models to different flood estimation problems, including
      estimation of model parameters, is provided in <xref linkend="book7"/>. </para>
    <para>As with other chapters of <xref linkend="book5"/>, this chapter deals primarily with rural
      catchments, and while the principles apply also for urban catchments, urban catchment
      hydrology is covered in detail in <xref linkend="book9"/>.</para>

    <title>Time-Area approaches</title>

      <title>Time-Area Theory</title>
      <para>Time-area approaches can be seen as an extension of the <emphasis role="italic">travel
          time</emphasis> concept used in the Rational Method. However, instead of using a single
        travel time or <emphasis role="italic">time of concentration</emphasis> for flow from the
        most remote point on the catchment to its outlet to calculate a peak discharge, time-area
        approaches use travel times from all parts of the catchment and calculate a complete flood
        hydrograph. Early development of the approach was carried out by
          <citation>b5_c6_r17+1</citation> and <citation>b5_c6_r33+1</citation>, while examples of
        time-area approaches are given in <citation>b5_c6_r2+1</citation>. </para>
      <para>The basic principle of time-area approaches, as illustrated in <xref
          linkend="b5_ch6_f_jm87i"/>, is that rainfall excess at any time <emphasis role="italic"
          >t-tt</emphasis> after the start of the storm that occurs at a point on the catchment with
        a travel time of <emphasis role="italic">tt</emphasis> to the catchment outlet will
        influence flow at the catchment outlet at time <emphasis role="italic">t</emphasis>. A
        fundamental assumption involved in this is that flow at the catchment outlet is influenced
        only when the runoff reaches the catchment outlet, i.e. when the individual water particles
        reach the catchment outlet. </para>

      <para>Points on the catchment which have equal travel times to the outlet can be joined to
        form isochrones. Application of the time-area method requires isochrones to be drawn for the
        catchment being considered; note that many computerised applications assume that the area
        increases in a linear manner on small subcatchments to avoid the need for delineation of
        isochrones. </para>
      <para>When construction of isochrones is required, a common assumption is that the travel time
        is related to the travel length (<emphasis role="italic">L</emphasis>) and slope (<emphasis role="italic">S</emphasis>) of the catchment by the following relationship: </para>

      <para><xref linkend="b5_ch6_e_e7e3u"/> follows directly from Manning’s equation, in which flow
        velocity is related to the square root of stream slope which is assumed to be the same as
        the energy gradient. However, as the flow moves downstream to the catchment outlet, the
        flatter stream slopes are accompanied by greater water depths, which may compensate for the
        decreasing stream slope in the Manning equation. Studies by <citation>b5_c6_r27+1</citation>
        and <citation>b5_c6_r32+1</citation> indicate that stream velocities essentially remain
        constant along the length of the stream and may even increase in a downstream direction. If
        velocities remain constant along the stream, the travel time would be directly related to
        travel distance by: </para>

      <para>A plot of the area between adjacent isochrones against the travel time produces a

      <para>Since there are many points on the catchment with travel times <emphasis role="italic">tt</emphasis> and corresponding times <emphasis role="italic">t-tt</emphasis> after the
        start of the storm, the flowrate at the outlet at time <emphasis role="italic">t</emphasis>
        is the sum of all possible combinations. As a simple example, if the catchment is divided
        into five segments using isochrones (<emphasis role="italic">Ai</emphasis>), and a storm has
        three periods of rainfall excess (<emphasis role="italic">Pj</emphasis> in mm/h) with both
        the isochrones and rainfall having the same time step, then the total time of the hydrograph
        is eight time steps. Also, the discharges from the catchment at successive time steps (equal
        to the isochrone interval) for this example are given by: </para>

      <title>Limitations of Time-Area Approaches</title>
      <para>Despite the use of the time-area approach in various models, the time-area concept has
        several limitations, including:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Isochrones of travel time usually are not known, except in a few experimental
            studies and must be estimated. These experimental catchments include those monitored by
              <citation>b5_c6_r30,b5_c6_r31</citation> using tracers to ascertain travel times. To
            overcome this disadvantage, many applications adopt a simplified time-area relationship.
            A common simplified relationship is based on a linear growth in area with time (in
            essence, an assumption of a rectangular shape with a length given by the response time
            and a width defined by the catchment area), and thus there is a need only to estimate a
            representative travel time for the conceptualised catchment. </para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>The time-area curve cannot be easily derived from recorded rainfall and streamflow
            data.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>Construction of the direct runoff hydrograph assumes that flow is translated to the
            outlet with a lag but without attenuation. In other words, a kinematic response is
            assumed. As a result of this, time area methods are more likely to be applicable to
            estimation of flows from small catchments and particularly to estimation of surface
            flows in urban catchments.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>The method is linear, i.e. a doubling of rainfall excess results is a doubling of
            predicted discharges, whereas data from many catchments, particularly the larger rural
            catchments, demonstrates a nonlinear response to changes in rainfall excess.</para>

      <title>Worked Example</title>
      <para>The example below illustrates the application of the time-area method to a small rural
        catchment. The steps in the method remain similar when applied to an urban catchment but the
        time-area diagram then needs to reflect differences in travel time over different types of
        catchment surfaces and different types of drainage systems.</para>
      <sidebar>
        <title>Example  - Hydrograph Calculation for Triangular Time-Area Curve</title>
        <para>A 5 hectare catchment has a time of concentration of 15 minutes. The time-area curve
          is assumed to be triangular in shape. (This is similar to the time-area curve used with
          the Cordery-Webb approach for development of synthetic unit hydrographs). The surface
          runoff hydrograph is to be estimated for a 21 minute storm event with the details of this
          event shown in <xref linkend="b5_ch6_t_21d9u"/>. </para>
        <para>Since the storm event has 7 periods, each of 3 minutes duration, the catchment will be
          divided into 5 subareas by isochrones spaced at 3 minute intervals. The hydrograph base
          length is given by the catchment time of concentration plus the storm duration, ie 15
          minutes + 21 minutes = 36 minutes. The total depth of rainfall excess is 8.1 mm (see
          Column 3 in <xref linkend="b5_ch6_f_mn6qf"/>). Using this depth of rainfall excess and the
          catchment area, the volume of direct runoff from the catchment is 405
            m<superscript>3</superscript>.</para>
        <para>The subarea sizes between each adjacent pair of 3 minute isochrones, proceeding from
          the outlet of the catchment to the top of the catchment, are 0.33, 0.67, 1.00, 1.33 and
          1.67 ha. The resultant time-area relationship is shown in <xref linkend="b5_ch6_f_mn6qf"

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <para>This section of Australian Rainfall and Runoff is based on the chapter on unit
        hydrographs prepared by <citation>b5_c6_r11+1</citation> for the previous edition of
        Australian Rainfall and Runoff. However, as the unit hydrograph approaches are no longer
        widely applied in Australia, only a brief introduction is given here. For a more detailed
        description of the unit hydrograph method and worked examples the reader is referred to

        <title>Basic Concepts</title>
        <para>Development of the unit hydrograph approach is generally attributed to
            <citation>b5_c6_r34+1</citation>. Unit hydrographs represent an advance over time-area
          procedures because, rather than constructing a time-area curve from isochrones of travel
          time, which requires assumptions regarding the travel times from all points on the
          catchment, the unit hydrograph represents the actual flood response of the catchment to
          rainfall, and can be directly determined or estimated from recorded rainfall and
          streamflow data. As a consequence, the resulting unit hydrograph incorporates the effects
          of both translation and attenuation, and so reduces the assumptions needed in the
          time-area approaches.</para>

        <title>Definition of a Unit Hydrograph</title>
        <para>A unit hydrograph is defined as the direct runoff hydrograph resulting from 1mm depth
          of rainfall excess, where the rainfall excess occurs over a particular time period and is
          uniformly distributed across the catchment. The time period of the rainfall excess sets
          the period of the unit hydrograph. Thus a rainfall burst which lasts 2 hours and has an
          average rainfall excess intensity of 0.5mm/h will produce a 2 hour unit hydrograph. It is
          important to note that the rainfall excess intensity should be uniform over the period of
          the burst, and that it also should be spatially uniform across the catchment. </para>
        <para>Direct runoff hydrographs result from the interaction between two important
          factors:</para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>the time varying storm rainfall hyetograph; and </para>

          <listitem>
            <para>the translation and attenuation properties of the catchment storage</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>In the special case of the unit hydrograph, a standardised rainfall excess (1 mm) is
          used, and the unit hydrograph, therefore, represents the effects of the catchment in
          delaying and attenuating rainfall excess as it flows from all points on the catchment to
          the catchment outlet. Use of this standardised rainfall excess provides the opportunity to
          relate the size and shape of the unit hydrograph to the catchment’s geophysical properties
          such as area, stream length and slope, and thus enables synthetic unit hydrographs to be
          estimated for catchments where no recorded streamflow data exists. </para>
        <para>Each unit hydrograph reflects the unique geophysical properties of the catchment and,
          hence, each catchment should have its own unique unit hydrograph.
            <citation>b5_c6_r3+1</citation> pioneered this concept by developing a dimensionless
          unit hydrograph which reflected the geophysical properties of the catchment. </para>
        <para>The basic principle of unit hydrograph theory is that the catchment responds in a
          linear manner to rainfall excess and, hence, superposition is feasible. As unit
          hydrographs form a linear system, the ordinates of the direct runoff hydrograph are
          linearly proportional to the depth of rainfall excess. For example, if the rainfall excess
          is doubled, each ordinate of the direct runoff hydrograph will be doubled. As another
          example, if a sequence of several periods of rainfall excess occurs, one after another,
          the resulting direct runoff hydrograph is equal to the sum of the runoff from each
          individual period of rain (see <xref linkend="b5_ch6_f_zr9or"/>).</para>
      </section>
      <section xml:id="b5_ch6_s_haf5u">
        <title>The Specified Period of the Unit Hydrograph</title>
        <para>The specified period of the unit hydrograph must be short enough to provide good
          definition of both the rainfall excess hyetograph and the resulting direct runoff
          hydrograph. This means the specified period should be short enough to provide a reasonable
          representation of all major changes of the rainfall excess intensity and should be less
          than a quarter of the time of rise of the unit hydrograph. Large rural catchments could
          have unit hydrographs with specified periods of 3 or more hours, whereas small urban
          catchments may require specified periods of 5 minutes or less. </para>
        <para>For a given catchment the unit hydrograph for a particular specified period will be
          different from those with different time specified periods. For example, a 1 hour unit
          hydrograph results from 1mm of rainfall excess falling over 1 hour at a rate of 1mm/h,
          whereas a 2 hour unit hydrograph results from 1mm of rainfall excess falling over 2 hours
          at a rate of 0.5 mm/h. In general, the peak discharges of unit hydrographs with longer
          specified periods will be lower and will occur later in time. This decrease in peak
          discharge arises as a result of the lower intensity of rainfall excess as the specified
          period of the unit hydrograph increases. </para>
        <para> The 1 hour unit hydrograph will be applied to a rainfall hyetograph with 1 hour rain
          periods, and will produce a direct runoff hydrograph with the ordinate values predicted
          every hour. The 2 hour unit hydrograph will be applied to a rainfall hyetograph with 2
          hour rain periods.</para>

      <section xml:id="b5_ch6_s_dcqm7">
        <title>Changing the Specified Period of a Unit Hydrograph</title>
        <para>To change the specified time period of the unit hydrograph two approaches are
          available, depending on whether a longer or a shorter specified period is needed. </para>
        <para>Calculation of a unit hydrograph of longer time period from one of a shorter period is
          accomplished by the addition of several short period unit hydrographs with each sequential
          unit hydrograph delayed by the specified period. Thus, the sum of four 15 minute unit
          hydrographs, each of which is delayed in time by 15 minutes, will produce a direct runoff
          hydrograph resulting from 4 mm of rainfall excess during a 1 hour period. Since a unit
          hydrograph is the result of 1 mm of rainfall excess during the specified time period, the
          1 hour unit hydrograph is derived from this runoff hydrograph by dividing all ordinates in
          the runoff hydrograph by four. </para>
        <para>Another situation in which the specified time period needs to be changed is where an
          instantaneous unit hydrograph has been obtained, as occurs in some synthetic unit
          hydrograph methods. The instantaneous unit hydrograph (IUH) represents the direct runoff
          hydrograph produced by 1 mm of rainfall excess which occurs at an instant in time. The
          ordinates of a specified period unit hydrograph at each time <emphasis role="italic"
            >t</emphasis> are obtained by integrating the ordinates of the IUH over an interval from
            <emphasis role="italic">t-T</emphasis> to <emphasis role="italic">T</emphasis>, where
            <emphasis role="italic">T</emphasis> is the specified time period, then dividing this
          result by <emphasis role="italic">T</emphasis>. Practically, this is achieved by averaging
          the IUH ordinates at times <emphasis role="italic">t</emphasis> and <emphasis
            role="italic">t-T</emphasis>. For example, each ordinate of a 1 hour unit hydrograph is
          the average of the IUH ordinates at this time and 1 hour before this time
            <citation>b5_c6_r7</citation>. </para>
        <para> The derivation of a unit hydrograph of shorter specified time period from one of a
          longer period is less direct, but can be attempted using an S-curve. Data errors will
          often produce oscillations in the S curve and it is often difficult to obtain good results
          when this method is applied to real data. (Details of the S-curve method are given in many
          textbooks, e.g. <citation>b5_c6_r2+1</citation>)</para>

      <title>Calculating Direct Runoff Hydrographs Using Unit Hydrographs</title>
      <para>Since superposition is assumed to be feasible with unit hydrographs, a storm with

        runoff hydrograph factored in proportion to the depth of rainfall excess. The direct runoff
        for the storm is then the sum of all <emphasis role="italic">j</emphasis> hydrographs. For
        the summation, the period of the unit hydrograph must be the same as incremental time period

              during significant flood events. Furthermore, the rainfall during the selected events
              should be spatially and temporally uniform over the catchment. If an insufficient
              number of large events is available then it may be necessary to use smaller floods. In
              this case it must be borne in mind that small floods will tend to produce unit

        <title>Selection of an Average Unit Hydrograph for the Catchment</title>
        <para>In principle, every unit hydrograph derived from various recorded storms on a
          catchment should be the same (since each catchment is considered to have a unique unit
          hydrograph). In practice, however, various factors such as spatial variation in rainfall,
          errors in data, or limited data (for example insufficient rain gauge coverage of the
          catchment) means that the unit hydrographs derived from different storms will be somewhat
          different from one another. <citation>b5_c6_r35+1</citation> found that the peak discharge
          of unit hydrographs derived from a range of storms on a catchment varied by a factor of 4,
          while <citation>b5_c6_r5+1</citation> found that the mean absolute deviation of the peak
          discharge was on average 31%. </para>
        <para>It is important, therefore, to derive several unit hydrographs for a catchment,
          selecting the larger storms. All derived unit hydrographs should be compared for
          consistency, and inconsistent ones rechecked or deleted. </para>
        <para>A plot of unit hydrograph peak discharge against the peak discharge of the recorded
          direct runoff hydrograph from which it was derived may reveal a trend for unit hydrograph
          peaks to increase for the larger floods. Any such trend is an indication that the
          catchment is not behaving in a linear manner. In these circumstances, it may be more
          appropriate to use an alternative technique for estimation of the direct runoff
          hydrograph. Catchments displaying a nonlinear response to storm events can still use the
          unit hydrograph approach, but it may be desirable to derive several unit hydrographs for
          the catchment, each one derived from, and being applicable to a particular range of flood
          sizes, as discussed by <citation>b5_c6_r4+1</citation>. </para>
        <para>The unit hydrographs which are considered to be acceptable can be averaged to produce
          a more representative unit hydrograph for the catchment. Averaging unit hydrographs in
          this way also has the benefit of reducing any oscillations on the recessions of unit
          hydrographs derived from multi-period storms. </para>
        <para>The recommended approach to calculate the average unit hydrograph is to align the
          peaks of all unit hydrographs, then average their ordinates at each successive time step
            <citation>b5_c6_r35</citation>. This method produces a unit hydrograph whose time to
          peak is the average of all times to peak, and peak discharge which is the average of all
          peak discharges. A simple average of all unit hydrographs, without regard for the
          occurrence of the peak is not recommended, as this can produce an average unit hydrograph
          which is quite different from the individual unit hydrographs (see <xref
            linkend="b5_ch6_f_muouq"/>). </para>

      <title>Synthetic Unit Hydrographs</title>
      <para>The synthetic unit hydrograph approach provides a means of estimating unit hydrographs
        for ungauged catchments. In essence the approach involves estimating the parameters of the
        unit hydrograph from relationships between these parameters and the physical characteristics
        of the catchment. These relationships may be derived by considering a number of catchments
        in a reasonably homogeneous area (with similar climatic and geomorphologic characteristics)
        for which unit hydrographs have been derived from recorded rainfall and streamflow data.
        These relationships are empirical and as such cannot be expected to be universally
        applicable. In general their application should be restricted to the region in which the
        relationships were derived. </para>
      <para>Of the various synthetic unit hydrograph approaches available, the only ones to have
        found widespread use in Australia are those based on the model of
          <citation>b5_c6_r10+1</citation>, commonly referred to as the Clark- Johnstone model. The
        Clark-Johnstone method has been simplified by <citation>b5_c6_r12+1</citation> to produce a
        model which is suitable for some limited applications. </para>
      <para>The Clark-Johnstone model involves the translation of rainfall excess to the outlet and
        routing this translated flow through a lumped concentrated storage at that location. It has
        been used quite widely for synthetic unit hydrograph derivation and has been shown to be
        applicable to most of the east coast of Australia <citation>b5_c6_r13</citation>. The basic
        assumption is that the shape of the unit hydrograph may be determined from two parameters,
        namely the base length of the time-area curve (C) and the catchment storage factor (K). </para>

      <title>Limitations of the Unit Hydrograph Approach</title>
      <para>The unit hydrograph is arguably the most direct way of characterising the response of a
        catchment to storm rainfall, as it takes account of all factors which influence the flood
        response to a particular rainfall excess input. The basic concept underlying the approach is
        simple to understand and easy to apply, being suited to both hand and spreadsheet
        calculations. The unit hydrograph approach can be applied with some confidence where its
        main assumptions are at least approximately satisfied: spatial uniformity of rainfall excess
        and linearity of catchment response.</para>
      <para>However, the simplifying assumptions made in the unit hydrograph approach impose the
        following limitations for its application in many practical situations:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Catchments generally respond in a non-linear fashion to rainfall excess inputs. This
            means that the travel time (or lag) varies with discharge or flood magnitude rather than
            being constant as implied by the linearity assumption. This limitation is particularly
            important when a significant degree of extrapolation is required from the magnitude of
            the observed events used in the derivation of the unit hydrograph to the magnitude of
            floods to be estimated.</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>Particularly in larger catchments the spatial distribution of rainfall and rainfall
            excess is generally non-uniform, and in very large catchments heavy rainfall may only
            occur over part of the catchment. In such catchments the unit hydrograph approach would
            be likely to produce flood hydrographs that are biased both in terms of their peak flow

    <title>Runoff Routing Approaches</title>
    <section xml:id="b5_ch6_s_bvooy">
      <title>Introduction</title>
      <para>The general term ‘runoff routing’ refers to flood hydrograph modelling approaches where
        a simplified conceptual representation is used to model the actual processes involved in the
        conversion of rainfall inputs to direct runoff (using a loss model – <xref linkend="b5_ch5"
        />), the contributions of baseflow (<xref linkend="b5_ch4"/>) and the translation of runoff
        from different points in the catchment to a flood hydrograph at the catchment outlet (using
        a routing model – <xref linkend="b5_ch3"/>). </para>
      <para>The actual flood formation processes in a catchment are complex and highly distributed
        in nature. Direct runoff generated from storm rainfall in the upper parts of the catchment
        initially moves downhill as shallow overland flow and is modified by the effects of various
        forms of detention storage as it moves over the catchment surface. It is then gradually
        concentrated into minor drainage pathways and successively combined with baseflows and flows
        from other pathways. These flows eventually reach well defined water courses, creeks or
        rivers and move downstream, being combined with other tributary flows on their way to the
        catchment outlet.</para>
      <para>A significant degree of simplification in the representation of the actual processes in
        models is made possible by the fact that catchments act on rainfall inputs as systems with a
        high degree of damping. This means that the streamflow hydrograph output at the catchment
        outlet does not reflect the ‘high frequency’ variations of the input in either the time or
        space dimensions. Similarly, small errors in modelling the various catchment processes may
        have little effect on the outflow hydrograph. This enables surprisingly accurate and useful
        results to be obtained from relatively simple models <citation>b5_c6_r24</citation>. </para>
      <para>The different groups of models developed in Australia and in other countries have
        adopted different conceptualisations of the actual flood formation processes, with different

        <para>A number of investigators (e.g. <citation>b5_c6_r37+1</citation>) have examined the
          relative roles of ‘hillslope’ (overland flow) processes and channel routing in the
          modelling of hydrologic response. Their conclusions indicate that in <emphasis
            role="italic">relatively small catchments</emphasis> the emphasis should be on
          appropriate modelling of the <emphasis role="italic">hillslope response</emphasis> to
          rainfall inputs, while the spatial variation of rainfall inputs and hillslope responses is
          less important. Lumped models (<xref linkend="b5_ch6_s_dcpm4"/>) or semi-distributed
          models with relatively simplistic representation of spatial variations (<xref
            linkend="b5_ch6_s_tonrm"/>) can thus produce acceptable flood hydrograph
          estimates.</para>
        <para>In contrast, in <emphasis role="italic">large (&gt;1000
            km<superscript>2</superscript>) to very large (&gt;10,000
            km<superscript>2</superscript>) catchments</emphasis> the flood response is governed
          primarily by the <emphasis role="italic">network geomorphology</emphasis> and the
            <emphasis role="italic">spatial distribution of runoff inputs</emphasis>. In these
          larger catchments, and in catchments with significant storage development, it is thus
          important to model the distributed nature of runoff inputs and to give a realistic
          representation of the actual drainage network in node-link type models (<xref
            linkend="b5_ch6_s_ccwdx"/>).</para>
        <para>In catchments of intermediate size, the overland flow and channel routing phases may
          be of similar importance in the overall catchment response to rainfall inputs, and it is
          thus desirable to model the flow routing in the overland flow segments separately from the
          flow routing in the drainage network segments. Similar considerations apply in catchments
          with significantly different land uses (e.g. urban or partly urbanised catchments), where
          runoff from subareas of different type is routed separately before routing in the pipe or
          channel network.</para>

        <title>Lumped Runoff Routing Models </title>
        <para>By definition, lumped models do not allow for the distributed nature of flood
          hydrograph formation in catchments. At the time of their development the application of
          hydrograph estimation models was restricted to hand calculations, requiring relatively
          simple models. However, lumped models can still play a useful role as a component of
          node-link type models, to represent the formation of runoff hydrographs from hillslope or
          overland flow segments as an input to the streamflow network. </para>
        <para>Apart from the Time-Area Method (<xref linkend="b5_ch6_s_ypsrh"/>) and the Unit
          Hydrograph Method (<xref linkend="b5_ch6_s_7b1zz"/>), the best known lumped runoff routing
          models are the Clark model <citation>b5_c6_r10</citation> and the Nash model
            <citation>b5_c6_r28</citation> illustrated in <xref linkend="b5_ch6_f_squoq"/>. The
          Clark model represents the translation and attenuation through a linear storage placed at
          the catchment outlet. By placing a number of linear storages in series and routing the
          rainfall excess input successively through this cascade of storages, the Nash model
          provides more flexibility in matching the routing response of the model to both the
          hydrograph translation and attenuation characteristics of the catchment.</para>

        <para>The example below illustrates the application of a simple runoff routing model to
          estimate design flood hydrographs for an ungauged catchment of medium size. In most
          practical applications the simple Clark model would be replaced by a node-link type runoff
          routing model, implemented through one of the readily available runoff routing modelling
          systems referred to in <xref linkend="b5_ch6_t_guimn"/> and <xref linkend="b5_ch6_t_h6tm7"
          />. However, the steps of estimating model parameters and model inputs for the design
          application remain similar. The example also illustrates the application of the critical
          rainfall duration concept.</para>

          <para>An ungauged catchment west of Melbourne has an area of 56

        <para>The original Laurenson Runoff Routing Model – LRRM
            <citation>b5_c6_r22,b5_c6_r23</citation> illustrated in <xref linkend="b5_ch6_f_62ynx"/>
          is an example of simple semi-distributed flood hydrograph estimation models. Similar to
          the time-area method, the LRRM divides the catchment into a number of sub-areas (typically
          10) on the basis of equal travel time to the catchment outlet (isochrones). However, it
          assigns a separate storage to each of the subareas, and runoff from a sub-area is then
          routed through the series of downstream storages to the catchment outlet. The division
          into sub-areas and the detailed representation of travel time in the catchment allows the
          effects of spatial variation of catchment rainfall to be modelled explicitly. </para>
        <para>The model uses nonlinear storages, with the relationship between discharge and storage
          represented by a power function, as discussed in <xref linkend="b5_c5_s_022"/> and
          expressed by <xref linkend="b5_c5_e_032"/>.</para>
        <para>The catchment representation in the LRRM can be regarded as a linear network of ten
          rainfall input nodes, ten routing links (each with a nonlinear concentrated storage) and
          one output node. While the LRRM was originally conceptualised as a runoff routing model
          for the whole catchment, it is now more typically used as model to represent the routing
          of overland flow in a hillslope segment to a channel network node, e.g. in the XPRAFTS

        <para>As explained in <xref linkend="b5_ch6_s_e27lz"/>, there are two distinctly different
          ways to convert the distributed rainfall excess inputs over a subarea into a runoff
          hydrograph at the subarea node (placed near the centroid of the subarea). These subarea
          runoff hydrographs are then routed progressively from one node through a routing link to
          the next node in the drainage network and eventually to the catchment outlet (<xref
            linkend="b5_ch6_s_bj1rv"/>). The concentrated or distributed storages used in these
          routing links are shown in <xref linkend="b5_ch6_s_e27lz"/> as small black
          triangles.</para>
        <para>Some of the routing links receive the outflow hydrograph from an upstream link as well
          as a subarea runoff hydrograph. In these links the two hydrographs are combined before
          they are routed through to the next node in the network. At stream junction nodes the two
          (or more) tributary hydrographs are combined by simple addition.</para>
        <para>The drainage network may also have a branched structure, where flows are diverted by
          natural or artificial features into a system of distributary or diversion channels, and
          these flows may or may not join up again with flows in the main channel. Most runoff
          routing modelling systems have the capability to represent the features controlling
          diversion and return flows. </para>
        <para>If the catchment includes areas with significant extra flood storage, such as natural
          lakes or swamps, extensive floodplain areas, reservoirs or flood retention/detention
          basins, these can also be included in the drainage network as ‘special storage’ nodes or
          links, with separately defined storage and discharge characteristics (<xref
            linkend="b5_ch6_s_6plz4"/>). </para>
        <para>The baseflow contributions to the total flood runoff hydrograph (<xref
            linkend="b5_ch4"/>) are typically modelled in a lumped fashion and added to the routed
          hydrograph at the catchment outlet. However, in more complex catchment situations with
          significant baseflow contributions it is desirable to model the distributed nature of
          baseflow contributions, by adding them at each runoff input node and routing the combined
          runoff hydrograph through the drainage network.</para>

      <para>The individual subareas of semi-distributed runoff routing models represent the runoff
        contributions from a relatively large part of a catchment (see <xref

        represent their combined input to the modelled stream or channel network
          <citation>b5_c6_r20</citation>. The mix and relative importance of different processes
        depends on the runoff production characteristics of a particular catchment. The scale of the
        modelled catchment also plays an important role, as with increasing size of the subareas a
        greater degree of averaging of the effects of different processes and modification of the
        runoff hydrograph though routing processes will occur, </para>
      <para>As discussed in more detail in <xref linkend="b4_ch2"/>, the runoff routing models
        routinely used in Australia employ very simplified representations of the processes involved
        in runoff production, generally dividing the rainfall inputs into a loss and rainfall excess
        component, and dealing only indirectly with baseflow contributions. The main distinction in
        the modelling of runoff from contributing areas is in how the routing of runoff within the
        subareas is treated.</para>

        <para>This subarea runoff hydrograph is input at a stream network node near the centroid of
          the subarea and then routed successively along the stream network to the catchment outlet.
          The modification of the hydrograph as it travels through the stream or channel network is
          generally modelled by a linear or nonlinear storage for each routing link (<xref
            linkend="b5_c5_s_004"/> and <xref linkend="b5_c5_s_022"/>). </para>
        <para>Examples of the application of the combined subarea and stream network routing
          approach include the RORB Runoff Routing Model <citation>b5_c6_r26</citation> and the
          Basic Model version of URBS <citation>b5_c6_r9</citation>.</para>
        <para>The key feature of this runoff routing conceptualisation is that all the translation
          and attenuation effects experienced by the runoff inputs on their way to the catchment
          outlet have to be represented in the routing through the channel links. </para>
        <para>The justification for the combined treatment of overland flow and stream/channel
          network routing is firstly that the separation of these two phases is somewhat arbitrary,
          in that the change from shallow distributed flow over hillslope surfaces to concentrated
          flow in water courses and streams is very gradual. Secondly, if the interest is only on
          hydrographs at the catchment outlet, the internal separation into different processes is
          of secondary importance, as long as the overall routing and delay characteristics of the
          catchment and their variation with flood magnitude can be adequately represented. As
          discussed in <xref linkend="b5_ch6_s_mme2x"/>, this condition is likely to be satisfied in
          large catchments with relatively uniform land use.</para>
        <para>The main limitation of this modelling approach is that it is designed to produce only
          an integrated catchment response hydrograph at or near the catchment outlet. As
          demonstrated by <citation>b5_c6_r38+1</citation>, this modelling approach does not satisfy
          the principles of ‘self-consistency’, as the storage parameter of an individual routing
          element depends on the size of the total catchment being modelled. While the model can
          output hydrographs at any internal node, hydrographs produced for the upper parts of the
          catchment are likely to show positive bias, as they tend to underestimate the degree of
          attenuation in the routing process.</para>

        <para>The hydrograph formation methods used by the first three groups of modelling systems
          have been described in previous chapters, as indicated in the last column of <xref
            linkend="b5_ch6_t_guimn"/>, and the methods used to estimate their parameters are
          described in the relevant user manuals. The catchment conceptualisation used in nonlinear
          storage routing models and kinematic wave routing models warrants some additional
          discussion (<xref linkend="b5_ch6_s_2nzyu"/> and <xref linkend="b5_ch6_s_0d855"/>
          respectively).</para>
        <para>The main advantage of modelling the overland flow phase separately is that this
          modelling approach can deal with different land uses in different parts of the catchment
          and changes to these land uses, such as substantial urbanisation. If the variation of the
          routing response with flood magnitude is quite different for the overland flow and channel
          routing phases, then a separate modelling approach lends itself better to extrapolation to
          Very Rare to Extreme flood events.</para>
        <para>The disadvantage of the separate overland and channel flow routing approach is that it
          requires additional parameters to model the contributing area or overland flow component
          of the overall catchment routing process. If appropriate information is not available to
          allow separate calibration of the parameters to the overland and channel routing
          processes, then it may be more appropriate to use a combined routing approach, as
          described above. </para>
        <para>More detailed approaches for modelling runoff from the overland flow segment have also
          been proposed and applied. The RRR model <citation>b5_c6_r21</citation> allows for the
          generation of the runoff hydrograph by two or more different processes, with different
          losses and subarea routing delays being applied to each runoff component.
            <citation>b5_c6_r20+1</citation> postulated three different conceptual processes that
          can contribute to runoff at the subarea scale: baseflow, ‘slow flow’ and ‘fast flow’. </para>
        <para> For urban catchments, further sub-division of the overland component on a spatial
          basis to allotment-size units and subsequent scaling up to the subareas has been proposed
          by <citation>b5_c6_r16+1</citation>.</para>

      <para>The parameters of the simple lag and storage routing models are generally estimated by
        analysis of or calibration to observed hydrographs in the catchment being modelled, or by
        transfer of information from gauged catchments in regions with similar streamflow
        characteristics. In these methods it is generally assumed that the same parameter set
        applies to the different routing links, except for an adjustment to reflect the different
        time lag associated with routing reaches of different lengths.</para>
      <para>In the Muskingum-Cunge Method, the kinematic wave and the dynamic routing methods the
        routing parameters can be determined from direct links with stream survey data and hydraulic
        flow characteristics, e.g. channel slope and hydraulic roughness (<xref
          linkend="b5_ch5_e_vfbd"/> and <xref linkend="b5_ch5_e_vfvdfbd"/>). These parameters will
        thus vary naturally with the topographic and hydraulic characteristics of the routing
        reaches.</para>
      <para>In the modelling systems using the nonlinear storage routing methods described in <xref

        the nonlinear storage-discharge relationship found from calibration to observed hydrographs
        typically varies in the range from 0.6 to 0.8. These values imply that with increasing flood
        magnitude discharge increases more rapidly than storage. A value of <emphasis role="italic"
          >m</emphasis> = 1.0 (linear storage) would imply that discharge and storage increase at
        the same rate). </para>
      <para>The expected variation of the exponent with flood magnitude is particularly important
        when appropriate routing parameter values for the estimation of Very Rare to Extreme floods

    <title>Rainfall on Grid Modelling Approaches</title>
    <section xml:id="b5_ch6_s_dflga">
      <title>Introduction</title>
      <para>The following description of the ‘rainfall-on-grid’ or ‘direct rainfall’ modelling
        approaches to runoff routing is based mainly on the Stage1/2 report from ARR Revision
        Project 15 ‘Two-dimensional (2D) modelling <citation>b5_c6_r1</citation>
      </para>
      <para>In contrast to the traditional rainfall runoff modelling approaches, the
        rainfall-on-grid approaches do not require the specification of a node-link type
        representation of the catchment and its drainage network. Instead they use information from
        a digital elevation model and hydraulic modelling to define the drainage paths used by
        floodwaters on their way towards the catchment outlet. In the flatter parts of a catchment
        the drainage paths may thus change adaptively during a flood event. </para>
      <para>The catchment is represented by a large number of grid cells, each with its individual
        rainfall input and runoff output – in other words, the cells act as the equivalent to
        subareas in node-link type models. However, the different scales of these basic catchment
        elements have important implications for the modelling of flood runoff, as they require
        different representations of the typical properties of the catchment elements. The
        non-linear nature of runoff generation means that the average response from many different
        small scale catchment elements cannot be expected to correspond to the lumped response of a
        subarea with average properties (e.g. a hillslope in a kinematic wave model).</para>
      <para>The rainfall-on-grid approaches can be applied in two ways:</para>

        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>The computational basis of the rainfall-on-grid approaches are the two-dimensional

        additional factors:</para>

      </itemizedlist>
      <para>In principle the model can accept a detailed space-time distribution of the rainfall
        inputs but in practice limited data availability means that more discretised rainfall inputs
        need to be used. </para>
      <para>The traditional loss models described in <xref linkend="b5_ch5"/> can be used but the
        way these losses are applied may vary in different models, and the traditional design loss
        values may thus not be directly applicable. Loss models that have a more direct physical
        basis could also be applied to reflect the varying infiltration, depression storage and
        transmission losses that reduce the volume of rainfall inputs but the required data and
        parameters estimates are not readily available. Finally, at least in theory, a groundwater
        model could be integrated to allow a consistent estimation of losses and baseflow
        contributions when modelling over an extending time period.</para>
      <para>The topographic information included in the model means that the model can include
        relatively large depression storage areas which interact with losses. A process of
        ‘pre-wetting’ these storage areas (priming the model with an artificial rainfall burst to
        fill depression storages) may have to be used to prevent low bias in modelled flood
        hydrographs.</para>
      <para>The model outputs are quite sensitive to the selection of the hydraulic roughness
        parameters. Because of the differences in conceptualisation and scale, these grid cell
        roughness parameters will generally be different from the values used in traditional channel
        hydraulics. Use of depth varying roughness parameters rather than constant ones may be
        necessary to reflect the changing hydraulic characteristics of catchment surfaces with flow
        depth.</para>
      <para>The modelling of urban areas requires consideration of the impacts of a mix of different
        catchment surfaces, buildings, drainage systems and other infrastructure. The model
        resolution will generally not allow these features to be represented in detail, thus
        representative cell characteristics need to be adopted, using some form of averaging of the
        detailed urban area characteristics.</para>

            The smaller flowpaths higher up in the catchment may not be as well-represented by the
            2D model as they may exist on a sub-grid scale. This may affect timing of runoff
            routing. </para>

          <para>The shallow flows generated in the direct rainfall approach may be outside the

      <para><emphasis role="italic">It is important for both users of rainfall-on-grid models and
          their clients to realise that greater detail in the representation of catchment
          physiography can only be expected to translate to greater accuracy of flood estimation
          results if this is accompanied by appropriate representation of hydrologic flood formation
          processes at the adopted special scale. Given the present simple representation of such
          processes and the difficulties of realistically representing shallow overland flows, it is
          considered that at present the main value of rain-on-grid models is their ability to
          accommodate the influences of hydraulic controls on flow conditions.</emphasis></para>
      <para><emphasis role="italic">At the current stage of development of these models and with the
          limited level of experience gained with their practical application, it is considered
          premature to recommend the general use of rainfall-on-grid models in these
          guidelines.</emphasis></para>
      <para><emphasis role="italic">However, it is expected that further development and testing
          will allow rainfall-on-grid models to be more widely applied.</emphasis></para>
