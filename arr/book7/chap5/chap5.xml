    <title>Application for Future Climates </title>
    
    
    <para>Presented in this section will be the steps necessary to use
        modelling systems for prediction of design floods in future climate
        regimes. Included in the discussion will be the need to change the
        catchment response parameters due to changes in geomorphology, vegetation,
        etc as well as the precipitation characteristics. Also discussed will be
        the current state of knowledge with respect to this problem and the
        resultant recommendations; in other words what should be done in the
        interim while further research is undertaken. </para>
