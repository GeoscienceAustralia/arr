    <para>There is a need to present alternative techniques for calibration
        ranging from manual to automatic. As part of this presentation, the
        conceptual aspects underpinning these need to be presented as these aspects
        are consistent over many alternative approaches. There is a need also to
        present the generic types of automatic calibration and the advantages and
        disadvantages of the alternative techniques. Introduced in this section will
        be alternative metrics for assessment of prediction accuracy. The advantages
        and disadvantages of these metrics will need to be presented together with
        selection of a metric for typical applications. In the discussion of the
        advantages and disadvantages, there is a need to highlight the inherent bias
        in some metrics and the influence of this on the resultant parameter
        evaluation. Furthermore, the concept that changing the problem may result in
        the need to change the metric and hence the parameter values. </para>
