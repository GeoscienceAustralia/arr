  <title>Event Modelling Systems</title>

  <para>The various concepts associated with application of event models will
  be presented in this section. Included will be specific details of the
  assumptions inherent in the application, namely the need for parameters that
  ensure frequency transformation with single burst simulation and the need
  for frequency analysis of predictions from the Monte-Carlo simulation.
  Detailed in the second and third sections will be specific details necessary
  for application of the relevant methods, and the advantages and
  disadvantages of both approaches.</para>
