  <title>Continuous Modelling Systems</title>

  <para>Outlined in this section will be the concepts associated with
  continuous simulation for design flood estimation. Of particular concern
  will be the differences between calibration for design flood estimation and
  yield estimation. Also included will be a discussion of the advantages and
  disadvantages of using continuous simulation for design flood
  estimation.</para>
