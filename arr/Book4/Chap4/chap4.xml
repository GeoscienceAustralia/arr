  <title>Catchment Modelling System Processes</title>

  <para>The final section of this book will be a discussion of the processes
  influencing catchment response to storm events. Furthermore, the importance
  of these processes will be linked to the conceptual components of a
  catchment modelling system. Finally, there needs to be a warning included in
  this section that is related to the application of modelling approaches,
  namely that the processes needed to generate information for a particular
  problem may well be different to the processes necessary for generation of
  information for a different problem. In other words, the importance of the
  processes will be defined by the problem.</para>
