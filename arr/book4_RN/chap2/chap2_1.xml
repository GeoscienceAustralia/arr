    <para>Outlined in this section is an introduction to the concept of a
        catchment modelling system comprising a system of process models that are
        combined to form the modelling system. In addition, the numerical aspects of
        the system need to be introduced also and particularly the concept that
        solving the same equations using differing techniques potentially will
        result in different predictions.</para>
