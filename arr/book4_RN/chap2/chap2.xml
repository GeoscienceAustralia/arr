        <title>Introduction</title>
        <para>Provide a broad description of the runoff processes that contribute to streamflows, ie
            interception, depression storage, infiltration, interflow, and groundwater
            contributions. Identification of those components of most relevance to flood generation,
            which leads to following sections.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Runoff generation</title>

        <para>Discussion of runoff generation processes, eg Hortonian overland flow, partial area
            runoff, saturation excess runoff, variable source areas, and subsurface storm flow, and
            link to simple loss models in Book 5 Chapter 5. Discuss difference in processes between
            urban and rural catchments.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Baseflow</title>

        <para>Discussion of groundwater processes, and link to simple baseflow models presented in
            Book 5 Chapter 4.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Flow routing</title>

        <para>Introduce different routing elements and different forms of storage (from hillslopes
            to streams, floodplains, natural and artificial storages). Discuss hydraulic basis (with
            link to relevant sections of Book 6) and simplified representation in hydrologic models
            (refer to Book 5). Also differences between natural waterways (rural catchments) and
            constructed drainage systems (urban catchments).</para>
    </section>
    <section>
        <title>Case studies</title>

        <para>Provide overview of case studies that illustrate runoff response to large rainfalls in
            an urban and rural catchments.</para>
