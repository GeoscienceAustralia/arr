    <title>Why Simulate Hydrographs?</title>
    <para>Discuss the need to simulate hydrographs, the importance of characterising both peak and
      volume, the advantages of using rainfall frequency curves to extrapolate flood frequency
      relationships. Introduce the need for probability-neutral transformation of rainfall to
      runoff, and the relationship between this Book and the guidance provided in Books 5, 6 and
      7.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Scope</title>
    <para>Outline the focus on catchment processes relevant to flood generation, event-based
      simulation (simple event, ensemble event, and Monte Carlo approaches), and continuous
      simulation, followed by the general treatment of joint probability for event-based and
      continuous simulation approaches, and the characterisation of uncertainty. </para>
