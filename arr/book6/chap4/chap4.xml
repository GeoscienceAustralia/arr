  <para>There is a need to provide both generic and specific information on
  uncertainty determination. The generic information would include the sources
  of uncertainty and the likely magnitude of the prediction uncertainty for
  those circumstances where an uncertainty analysis is not undertaken. This
  generic magnitude needs to be developed as part of P22 projects. In addition
  to the generic information, a framework for an uncertainty analysis needs to
  be presented for those situations where an uncertainty analysis is
  warranted. Within the framework, guidance on different approaches needs to
  be provided with advantages and disadvantages of each approach
  outlined.</para>
