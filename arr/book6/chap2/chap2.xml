    <para>Hydraulic computations are usually carried out to determine:</para>

        <para>flow depths or water levels (e.g. for recorded floods or
        synthesised floods of a particular magnitude),</para>

        hydraulic structures or flow around bends).</para>

    </itemizedlist>

    <para>Hydraulic computations can be undertaken using ‘pencil and paper’,
    spreadsheets or computer programs (freeware or proprietary software). The
    level of detail in which the calculations are completed will depend upon
    the nature of the hydraulic investigation (including the risks to life and
    property and the complexity of the flows), the size of the budget and the
    availability of time and data to undertake the investigation. In some
    circumstances, it is desirable to make recourse to physical models rather
    than computational models, but considerations of this nature will be
    detailed in Section 13</para>

    <title>Objectives and Scope</title>

    <para>The primary objective of this book is to provide a document which
    provides background information to assist practising engineers to carry
    out calculations or hydraulic investigations related to free surface
    flows. The needs for such calculations or investigations may be related to
    floods (inundation levels, concentration of flows to endanger life, the
    power of flood flows to threaten or impair structural integrity or even
    wash away structures, and bed level scour), stormwater disposal, water
    supply distribution systems and sewerage collection systems (the
    installation of new systems or augmentation of existing systems).</para>

    <para>The present document concentrates on free surface flows but brief
    consideration is given to pressurised or closed conduit flows. There are
    also several closely related topics which are the subject of separate
    books viz numerical models and hydraulic structures.</para>

    <title>General Characteristics of Open Channels</title>

    <para>Open channels can be natural or man-made. The cross-sections of
    natural channels are irregular, usually broader than deep and they may
    consist of a deeper in-bank channel as well as an overbank area. During
    floods, the flow frequently leaves the in-bank channel and enters the
    over-bank area. See Figure 1.</para>

    <figure xml:id="b6_ch2_f_kgjk2">
      <title>Figure 1: Schematic of a natural channel showing in-bank and
      over-bank areas. (Adapted from Figure 3.10 in [12].)</title>

    </figure>

    <para>At bends in the water course, natural cross-sections are
    asymmetrical; they tend to be deeper on the outside of the bend due to the
    effect of helicoidal secondary currents which tend to scour the outside of
    the bend and deposit sediment at the inside of the bend. See Figure
    2.</para>

    <para>The cross-sections of man-made channels are usually rectangular,
    trapezoidal, triangular or circular. Stormwater channels often have a
    small deeper indentation along the centreline of the channel for easy
    cleaning and containing trickles. Some man-made channel cross-sections are
    depicted in Figure 3.</para>

    <para>Since the channel roughness affects the flow, it is important to be
    able to quantify the roughness. The roughness in channels is determined by
    the materials from which the channel is cut or made, including anything
    any vegetation which is growing (or lodged) in the channel. In man-made
    channels, the roughness must also include the effects of any jointing
    between panels, slabs or pipes.</para>

    <para>Apart from channel roughness, the main parameters associated with
    the channels are: (i) the cross-sectional area (measured in a
    cross-section at right angles to the flow direction A), (ii) the depth y
    (especially for man-made channels, (iii) the top width b (sometimes also
    called the storage width), (iv) the wetted perimeter P, (v) the hydraulic
    radius R<subscript>h</subscript> and (vi) the stage h.</para>

    <para>Depth is usually measured vertically up from the bottom point in the
    cross-section (rather than at right angles to the bed), while stage is
    measured vertically from a datum to the top of the water surface. See
    Figure 4.</para>

    <para>The total head (H) associated with a free surface flow has
    dimensions of energy per unit weight of fluid (i.e. length) and units of
    Joules per Newton (i.e. metres) and is given by:</para>

      <para>Specific energy is a concept which is useful for determining the
      water surface profile through smooth transitions such as a channel
      narrowing, a smooth hump or smooth step in the channel or a combination
      of these channel transitions.</para>

      <para>The equations defining total head (1) and specific energy (2) have
      two assumptions built into them, viz: (i) the pressure distribution is
      hydrostatic since the streamlines are straight and parallel, and (ii)
      that depth measured vertically (<emphasis>y</emphasis>) is a good
      approximation to the actual pressure head (<emphasis>y</emphasis>.
      cos<superscript>2</superscript><emphasis>θ</emphasis> ) in an open
      channel flow with a bed inclined at<emphasis> θ</emphasis> to the
      horizontal. For example, a bedslope (S = tan<emphasis>θ</emphasis> )
      which is as steep as 1V:10H (or <emphasis>θ</emphasis> = 5.7° ) only
      gives rise to an error which is close to 1% in the pressure head i.e. y.
      cos<superscript>2</superscript>(5.7° ) =
      0.99<emphasis>y</emphasis>.</para>

      <para>The need for the kinetic energy coefficient () in equations (1)
      and (2) arises whenever the velocity is non-uniform over the flow
      cross-section. In the case of a uniform velocity over a cross-section,
      α= 1. Departures from a uniform velocity over a cross-section, result in
      the cube of the mean velocity over the cross-section having a different
      value from the cube of the velocity (at each point in the cross-section)
      when averaged over the cross-section.</para>

      <para>In a steady flow, the application of the continuity equation to
      fluid flow through a streamtube involves equating the mass flux
      (<emphasis>ρ</emphasis><emphasis>Q</emphasis>) at an upstream section to
      the mass flux at another section further downstream. Similarly, in
      applying the energy equation (at the fundamental level for a fluid i.e.
      energy flux rather than energy) to the same streamtube, the energy flux
      (<emphasis>ρgQH</emphasis>) at the upstream section is equated to the
      energy flux at the downstream section provided there are no energy
      losses (or gains).</para>

      <para>In those idealised situations where the velocity at each
      cross-section of the streamtube is uniform, equating the two energy
      fluxes degenerates into equating the total head at the two sections.
      Whenever the velocity over the flow cross-section is non-uniform, use of
      the kinetic energy coefficient (and this is its utility) enables us to
      write down expressions for the velocity head in terms of the
      cross-sectionally averaged velocity (<emphasis>u</emphasis>); the
      cross-sectionally averaged velocity is the most convenient velocity upon
      which to base any computations.</para>

      the cross-section, the flux of KE per unit weight and time is.</para>

      <title>Uniform Flow</title>

      <para>Uniform flow is a useful reference condition in which the depth of
      flow (as well as the flow velocity) down a prismatic channel remains
      constant. The water is neither accelerating nor decelerating. Such a
      condition is brought about by the equilibration of two opposing forces,
      viz:</para>

          sin<emphasis>θ</emphasis> ) which tends to accelerate the flow,
          and</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>the frictional shear force (F<subscript>T</subscript>) which
          opposes the motion of the water and acts in the longitudinal
          direction, tangential to the flow boundary of the channel in contact
          with the water (see Figure 5). The shear force acts around the
          wetted perimeter of the channel cross-section.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>The schematic in Figure 5 depicts the dominant forces acting on an
      elemental volume of water. For the flow condition of uniform flow, all
      the forces cancel out and there is no nett force acting on the fluid
      element since <emphasis>W</emphasis>. sin <emphasis>θ</emphasis>=
      F<subscript>T</subscript>.</para>

      <para>Because the hydrostatic pressure forces on the two ends of the
      control volume cancel each other out, they do not enter the picture
      here. In uniform flow, the bedslope S<subscript>o</subscript>, the slope
      of the water surface S<subscript>ws</subscript> and the slope of the
      total head line S<subscript>f</subscript> are all equal, to S
      (say).</para>

      <para>While uniform flow rarely (if ever) occurs in nature, it may be a
      reasonable approximation for the flow down a long, prismatic, man-made
      channel or as a first pass for a natural channel.</para>

      <para>Sections at which the flow is critical are special in that there
      is a unique relation between velocity (or rate of flow) and depth,
      irrespective of the channel roughness or bedslope. Such sections are
      technically known as controls4 and examples of locations where they
      occur might are: (i) a sudden steepening of the channel bedslope, (ii) a
      brink (or overflow), (iii) a hump of sufficient height, (iv) an upwards
      step of sufficient height, or (v) a narrowing of the channel which is
      sufficiently constricting, (vi) flow from a reservoir or lake into a
      channel, (vii) a hydraulic structure such as a weir or sluice
      gate.</para>

      <para>In an open channel with various features such those listed above,
      it is possible that if the flow changes, so too can the control(s). For
      a given flow, a channel can have more than one control. The actual
      controls can only be identified through a trial and error process in
      which channel feature(s) is/are assumed to be control(s), and the
      computations on the backwater and drawdown curves completed. If the
      resulting water surface profile is compatible with the known boundary
      conditions at both ends of the channel, then the assumed control(s) are
      valid. If, on the other hand, an incompatibility is reached, it means
      that one of more of the assumptions regarding the controls needs to be
      changed and the solution process of calculating the water surface
      profiles is repeated until compatibility with all imposed boundary
      conditions is achieved.</para>

      <para>In a channel with a number of potential controls, the above
      solution process can be lengthy and require a number of trials.</para>

      <title>Bed Shear Stress</title>

      <para>As soon as there is movement of water through a channel or pipe, a
      resistive shear force is mobilised which opposes the motion of the water
      down the channel with slope S = tanθ . This shear force (or friction
      force) is developed around the wetted perimeter or periphery (P) of the
      channel or conduit and has its origins in the (albeit small) viscosity
      of the water. The shear force arises from a combination of (i) the
      viscous skin drag between the moving fluid and the flow boundary and
      (ii) the form drag on the roughness projections of the flow
      boundary.</para>

      <para>While a shear force is also developed at the air-water interface,
      it is negligible in comparison to the shear force around the interface
      of the water and channel (or water and pipe wall).</para>

      <para>An expression for the bed shear stress for uniform flow (o) can be
      determined by equating the two forces acting on the fluid element of
      length L in Figure 5.</para>

          <para>When k<subscript>s</subscript> refers to the roughness of a
          pipe or a man-made surface such as concrete,
          k<subscript>s</subscript> is also known as the equivalent sand grain
          roughness, after the definitive experimental work of Nikuradse in
          1933<superscript>5</superscript>. Nikuradse conducted experiments
          aimed at measuring the head losses in pipes of varying roughness. In
          each experiment Nikuradse conducted, he coated the inside wall of
          the pipe with sand grains of approximately the same size. Nikuradse
          tested pipes with internal coatings of various discrete grain sizes,
          lengths and diameters and at various Reynolds numbers for the flow.
          In each case he measured the resulting headloss along the
          pipe.</para>

      <para>For commercial pipes (with their various pipe-to-pipe joints), the
      wall roughness will have a different geometry and distribution of
      roughness projection heights compared to Nikuradse’s sand coated
      pipes.</para>

      <para>The commercial pipe with an equivalent sand grain roughness is the
      pipe with the same size and length which yields the same head loss as a
      pipe coated with sand of a particular size. Data on commercial pipes (or
      other man-made surfaces) will include the equivalent sand grain
      roughness.</para>

      <para>As pipes in service age, their walls become rougher through
      deterioration of the pipe wall and/or build-up of algal slimes. The
      equivalent sand grain roughness of pipes tends to increase with time and
      only through cleaning the pipes can the roughness

        </itemizedlist>

        <para>The effect of the roughness of the boundary surface on the value
        of the Chezy coefficient is quantified by the (wall) roughness
        (projection height) parameter (k<subscript>s</subscript>) while the
        effect of the viscosity of the water is incorporated in the thickness
        of the viscous sublayer (δ<subscript>s</subscript>). The viscous
        sublayer is the very thin region of chaotic flow dominated by the
        viscous force and which separates the stationary fluid immediately in
        contact with the stationary flow boundary and the overlying turbulent
        boundary layer.</para>

        <para>It is evident from the denominator in equation (6) that there
        are two extremes of turbulent flow:</para>

            <para>the viscous force dominates i.e. δ<subscript>s</subscript>
            &gt;&gt; k<subscript>s</subscript>; the roughness projection
            elements are fully immersed in the viscous sublayer (see Figure 7)
            and the value of the Chezy coefficient is independent of the wall
            roughness projection height k<subscript>s</subscript>. This
            extreme flow condition is known as hydraulically smooth turbulent
            flow and is unlikely in most practical situations.</para>

          <listitem>
            <para>the drag forces on the roughness projection protuberances
            dominate i.e. k<subscript>s</subscript> &gt;&gt;
            δ<subscript>s</subscript>; the roughness projection elements are
            sufficiently long to break down or protrude through and rupture
            the viscous sublayer and the value of the Chezy coefficient (and
            the uniform flow velocity) is independent of the fluid viscosity.
            This extreme flow condition is known as hydraulically rough
            turbulent flow and is normally the case when the Reynolds number
            R<subscript>e</subscript> &gt; 10<superscript>6</superscript>
            (approximately) and would commonly occur in earthen or natural
            channels. For hydraulically rough flow, equation (6) can be
            simplified and the value of the Chezy coefficient can then be
            determined from</para>

          dimensions of L<superscript>-1/3.T 1</superscript> .</para>

          of n are independent of time, as would be expected of a roughness
          parameter and only involve length. n is a measure of the absolute
          roughness of the channel surface. In this case, it is assumed that
          there is a coefficient of unity equal to √g/ 9.81 attached to the
          right hand side of the Manning equation (10). In engineering
          practice, this is perhaps the most commonly adopted version for the

      <para>The dimensionless coefficient K needs to be evaluated through

      expansion is treated as a local loss or not is a matter for judgement.
      In channels with, for example, a significant and sudden contraction due
      to the presence of bridge piers in the water course, the energy losses
      due to the flow contraction would appropriately be treated as a local
      loss rather than be incorporated into a Manning ‘n’ for a reach of water
      course.</para>

    <title>Classification of the 1D Backwater and Drawdown Water Surface

    <para>When the gradually varied flow equation is applied to a steady flow
    down a prismatic channel, it can be shown that there are 12 generic,
    gradually varied flow, water surface profiles (apart from uniform flow).
    These profiles can be classified according to (p 34-35 [10]):</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>5 conditions which compare the normal depth
        (y<subscript>o</subscript>) with the critical depth

        bedslopes.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>3 conditions which compare the actual depth (y) with the normal
        depth (y<subscript>o</subscript>) and the critical depth
        (y<subscript>c</subscript>). This results in 3 zones for the
        depth.</para>
      </listitem>

    <para>Table 4 contains the bedslope and depth classifications.</para>

    <para>The 12 gradually varied flow profiles are illustrated in Figure
    11.</para>

    <para>The 12 generic profiles are curves of increasing or decreasing
    curvature in either the downstream or upstream direction. When some
    simplifying assumptions are made (IF<superscript>2</superscript> &lt;&lt;1
    and a linearisation about normal flow depth using a Taylor series has been
    employed), it has been shown that the departure of the actual depth (y)
    from the normal flow depth (y<subscript>o</subscript>) follows an
    exponential variation in space ([24], [10]); this is of the form y
    −y<subscript>o</subscript>~e- dS<subscript>f</subscript>
    /d<subscript>x</subscript> x provided IF &lt;&lt; 1 and where
    S<subscript>f</subscript> can be found from the Manning or Chezy
    equation.</para>

    <para>A consequence of the nature of the se profiles is that any errors
    introduced during a backwater computation tend to be systematic. As the
    computations proceed in one direction (be it downstream or upstream), the
    flow curvature continuously increases or decreases.</para>

      <para>= friction force per unit weight of fluid</para>

      <para>S<subscript>e</subscript> =</para>

      <para>The label of ‘Saint Venant equations’ is commonly encountered in
      the literature; it refers to the 1D continuity and momentum
      equations.</para>

      <para>In practice, the equations of momentum and energy are sometimes
      erroneously mixed. While the momentum and energy equations (viz
      equations (12) and (13) respectively) are similar, they are
      fundamentally different. The differences between the 1D equations arise
      from three sources: (i) the velocity distribution over the cross-section
      (as captured in the momentum and kinetic energy coefficients α and β
      respectively), (ii) the lateral inflow terms and (iii) the friction
      slope (S<subscript>f</subscript> ) and the energy slope
      (S<subscript>e</subscript>).</para>

      <para>If the velocity is uniform over the cross-section ( α=β= 1), there
      is no lateral inflow (or outflow), and the energy slope is taken to be
      the same as the friction slope (as is usually done in practice), the 1D
      momentum and energy equations become the same equation:</para>

    <para>All the sections and subsections on physical modelling have borrowed
    heavily from the previous version of Australian Rainfall and Runoff i.e.
    Chapter 4 by B. S. Jenkins ([15]). The treatment of physical modelling
    presented here is an overview. For more details on physical modelling, the
    interested reader is referred to [28], [27], [20], [26] or [30].</para>

      <title>Introduction</title>

      <para>The first designed physical model pre-dates the routine use of
      numerical models in hydraulic engineering practice by approximately a
      century. Prior to the advent of digital computers, physical models
      offered the most practical means for the investigation of problems
      involving complex bathymetry, sediment transport, unsteady flow and 2D
      or 3D flow.</para>

      <para>Since the advent of numerical models, the domain of application of
      physical models has been shrinking. However, certain problems remain
      which are still more appropriately investigated through the use of
      physical models, and this is likely to remain the case for some time
      yet. Further consideration between the choice of physical model versus
      numerical model will be given in Section 13.</para>

      <para>Physical models have been around for hundreds of years, however,
      it was only in 1885 when the first physical model study based on
      scientific principles, was undertaken. This model study was conducted by
      Osborne Reynolds for investigating the tidal currents in the Mersey
      Estuary near Liverpool, England. Reynolds is reputedly the first person
      to introduce the time scale into physical modelling (p2 [17], p69 [1]).
      His first model was distorted with the vertical and horizontal length
      scales differing by a factor of 33.1. The model sides were vertical and
      initially, the bed of sand was flat. After a period of model operation
      however, Reynolds observed that the bed was reshaped with the principal
      features of the natural estuary. This early success provided the impetus
      for Reynolds to follow up on this work with another bigger model, again
      of the Mersey Estuary.</para>

      <para>The sorts of problems for which physical and numerical models are
      suited, are somewhat complementary, but this aspect will be considered
      in Section 13.</para>

      <title>The Basis for Physical Model Design</title>

      <para>Physical models are scaled (usually reduced) representations of
      the real life or prototype flows and their boundaries. The flow
      boundaries may be:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>fixed bed - often made out of cement mortar. Such models yield
          information about the flow patterns and velocity field in, for
          example, estuaries, river channels or tidal inlets.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>mobile bed - with the model bed typically consisting of one of
          the following: sand, particles of coal or a granulated plastic.
          Mobile bed models yield (qualitative) information about the sediment
          movement as well as the water motion; they are of interest for
          investigating scour holes, or regions of sediment accretion or
          erosion.</para>
        </listitem>

      <para>The flow boundaries of a modelled region of interest can
      be:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>natural where the flood plains and river channels of fixed bed
          models are constructed by first locating a series of templates made
          out of metal or plywood into position. Vertically, these sections
          are positioned using a theodolite. The channel bed and land form
          between the templates is interpolated. Sand is used as a fill
          material between the templates, and then a cement mortar capping is
          applied and frequently painted. See Figure 14.</para>

          hydraulic structures such as a culvert, pipe, drainage channel,
          basin, levee, spillway or outlet works. In the model, hydraulic
          structures could be made out of (painted) timber, marine plywood,
          PVC pipes and also perspex when visibility is a consideration e.g.
          for tracing the flow patterns through a structure with the use of a
          dye. See Figure ??.</para>

      <para>Accurate simulation of the flows in a physical model requires

      <itemizedlist>

          Geometric similitude is secured by ensuring that the model is a
          scaled reproduction of the prototype.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>dynamic similitude requires that all forces (be they pressure
          forces, weight, boundary friction forces, drag forces, surface
          tension forces, centripetal forces) at each point in the flow domain
          are each scaled by the same factor between model and prototype. If
          this were to be achieved, the force polygon acting on each elemental
          fluid parcel in the flow field, would have the same geometry in
          model and prototype; this is referred to as complete similitude.
          Complete similitude is the ideal situation, but in practice, is
          impossible to achieve. The reasons for this are twofold.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Firstly, the scaling requirements of the various forces are
      incompatible because some forces act through volumes (e.g. gravity and
      centripetal forces), other forces act over areas (e.g. pressure, drag
      and viscous forces) and another force acts over lengths (the surface
      tension force). The scales associated with volumes, areas and lengths
      are different. Consequently, the forces associated with volumes, areas
      and lengths will, in general, scale differently. If a model was built
      full scale, all forces would scale correctly. However, the smaller the
      model compared to the prototype, the larger the length scale and the
      greater the discrepancy between the scalings of the various forces which
      act through volumes or over areas or lengths.</para>

      <para>Secondly, the limited fluids available for use in models (in terms
      of their fluid properties of density and viscosity, and cost and safety)
      restrict the range of length scales which can be used in physical
      models. In nearly all cases in engineering practice, the fluids used in
      hydraulic models are water (and occasionally air). Consequently, a
      compromise has to be reached in which only the dominant forces are
      correctly scaled by the same factor, and the incorrect scalings of the
      smaller forces are of negligible consequence in a well designed model.
      This is termed incomplete similitude.</para>

      <para>The task of the modeller is to identify the dominant forces,
      ensure that these forces are scaled correctly, and disregard any
      insignificant forces. The effects (i.e. errors) due to those incorrectly
      scaled, insignificant forces are known as scale effects. In current
      engineering practice, most hydraulic investigations involve free surface
      flows and to a much lesser extent, pressurised or closed conduit flows.
      These two types of problems require different scaling criteria:</para>

      <para>In free surface flows, the dominant forces are usually gravity,
      the associated pressure force, and boundary friction. By asserting
      equality of the Froude number between model and prototype at all points
      in the flow field, the gravity and pressure forces are scaled by the
      same (desired) factor. By adjusting the model boundary roughness,
      consistent scaling of the boundary friction force is then achieved.
      Dynamic similitude is achieved provided the scale effects are
      negligible. A model which is based on pointto- point equality of the
      Froude number between model and prototype is known as a Froude model.
      Effectively, what the modeller is doing here is to ensure that gravity,
      pressure and boundary friction forces are scaled consistently. All other
      forces are insignificant and so the momentum equation (or equations if
      in 2D or 3D) for any elemental parcel of fluid in the model mimics (i.e.
      is a scaled version of) the momentum equation(s) for the corresponding
      elemental parcel of fluid in the prototype. Dynamic similitude means
      that the corresponding terms in the model and prototype momentum
      equations for each of the dominant forces are all related by a constant
      factor. In models of closed conduit or pressurised flows, such as flows
      through pipes, the dynamic scaling requirement is that there is
      point-to-point equality of the Reynolds number in model and prototype.
      The dominant forces are the viscous and pressure forces which are
      correctly scaled in a Reynolds model.</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>kinematic similitude requires the flow patterns in the model
          and prototype to be geometrically similar. In other words, the
          velocities at all points in the model, bear the same ratio between
          model and prototype. If this is achieved, then the model is in
          similitude with the prototype.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>If any two of the above three kinds of similitude are satisfied,
      then the remaining similitude is inferred. In normal modelling practice,
      models are designed to satisfy both geometric and dynamic similitude. It
      then follows that kinematic similitude is also satisfied. The usual
      approach to model design is to satisfy geometric similitude through
      careful model construction and dynamic similitude by adopting the
      appropriate modelling criterion. In general, there are various modelling
      criteria involving various dimensionless numbers, but in practice, the
      most common criterion which has been mentioned above, is based on the
      Froude number (for free surface flows). The next most common criterion
      is based on the Reynolds number (for closed conduit or pressurised
      flows).</para>

      <para>The Froude number may be regarded as the ratio of the inertial (or
      resultant) force to the gravity force, and the Reynolds number as the
      ratio of the inertial force to the viscous force. In models based on the
      Froude criterion or the Reynolds criterion, the correct scaling of the
      ubiquitous pressure forces is also achieved and the question arises as
      to how this comes about. The reason is that if the dominant forces
      (including the resultant force) are all correctly scaled, then the force
      polygon in model and prototype will also be correctly scaled.
      Consequently, one of these forces is a dependent force and this is taken
      to be the pressure force in Froude and Reynolds type models (p139
      [28]).</para>

      <para>If once again, we consider any small parcel of fluid in the
      prototype, what is required of the model is that the corresponding
      parcel of fluid in the model moves along the corresponding path at a
      scaled velocity of the prototype velocity. For this to happen, all
      forces (weight, pressure, drag, viscous, surface tension, elastic)
      acting on that parcel of fluid in the prototype must be in the same
      proportions to each other in the model. If this is the case, then there
      would be complete similitude between model and prototype. However, the
      various forces scale in different ways: some forces scale as the length
      cubed (e.g. weight, centripetal forces), other forces scale as length
      squared (e.g. pressure) and one other scales as length (i.e. surface
      tension). Therefore, as soon as the length scale departs from unity
      (i.e. full scale model), it is impossible or very difficult for all
      these forces to scale together in the same proportion.</para>

      <para>Fortunately, however, it is frequently the case, that there are
      one or two dominant forces present in the flow field and it is therefore
      of no consequence if the minor forces are not scaled correctly, so long
      as the dominant forces are. This is termed incomplete similitude.</para>

      <title>Distorted Models</title>

      <para>It is often useful to be able to distort a physical model by
      asserting different length scales in the horizontal and vertical
      directions. While undistorted models should be used whenever there is
      significant vertical and horizontal fluid motion, distorted models can
      be used whenever the fluid motion is mainly in the horizontal plain. As
      a rule of thumb, care should be taken whenever the horizontal to
      vertical length scales differ by more than a factor of about 5. (Recall
      that the first model of Reynolds had a distortion of 33.1.)</para>

      <para>The advantage of distorting a free surface flow model is that for
      the same plan area of model, the depths of flow will be deeper in the
      distorted model. In nearly all prototype free surface flows7, the flow
      is turbulent; and prototype turbulent flows can only be simulated in a
      model with turbulent flows. For example, if a model is distorted by a
      factor of 5, for the same (available) plan area, the model depths would
      be deeper by a factor of √5 and the model velocities would be greater by
      a factor of p 5 when compared to an undistorted model. Consequently, the
      Reynolds numbers in the distorted model will be greater by a factor of
      5<superscript>3/2</superscript> = 11.2 compared to the corresponding

      <para>It is evident from equation (26) that n<subscript>r</subscript>
      depends upon the hydraulic radius scale
      ((R<subscript>h</subscript>)<subscript>r</subscript>) and for a
      distorted model, this in turn depends upon both
      x<subscript>r</subscript> and z<subscript>r</subscript>. One consequence
      of distortion is that the friction forces at the model bed are
      under-represented. Equation (26) indicates that usually, the Manning’s n
      in the model should be greater than the Manning’s n in the prototype.
      For a model made out of cement mortar, the model roughness will be too
      smooth and additional artificial roughness has to be applied to the
      surface of the model. This can take the form of coarse sand, pebbles or
      other roughness elements glued to the model surface; sometimes a light
      gauge wire mesh is attached to the model. Model roughness is adjusted
      empirically during the calibration phase of the model
      investigation.</para>

      <para>Figure 16 is of a distorted flood model in which the model
      roughness was increased in two ways:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>the overbank areas were artificially roughened with
          appropriately spaced and patterned, vertical dowels or roughness
          elements. The dowels exert a drag force on the water moving over the
          model floodplain; this additional force is designed to make up for
          the deficit of boundary friction at the overly smooth model
          bed.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>the inbank areas were roughened with small pads of synthetic
          fibrous material. The spacing of these pads was adjusted by trial
          and error until the slope of the water surface matched the required
          slope.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>If the roughness in the model is too smooth, not only will the
      magnitude of the velocities be too large, but also, the flow pathlines
      will tend to be too straight. The opposite trends tend to occur in a
      model which is too rough.</para>

      <para>In the design of the distorted model depicted in Figure 16, it was
      known that found while the model simulation of floods with a 50 year and
      100 year return period satisfied the requirement for turbulent flow in
      the model, the model flow corresponding to a smaller flood with a return
      period of 25 years was transitional between laminar and turbulent and
      therefore could not be tested in the model.</para>

      <para>In an undistorted model with n<subscript>r</subscript> =
      L<subscript>r</subscript><superscript>1/6</superscript> , the Manning’s
      n for the model surface is too high. Model spillways are usually
      constructed of timber and marine plywood and the usual approach is to
      try and achieve as smooth a surface as possible through sanding and
      painting, and to tolerate the mismatch. Because the boundary friction
      forces in this flow scenario are not as important as the dominant
      gravity force, any scale effect in the model roughness is not usually
      significant.</para>

      <title>Mobile Bed Models</title>

      <para>Physical models can be classified as (i) fixed bed or (ii) mobile
      bed. Most studies by physical models are of the fixed bad variety. In
      fixed bed models, the bottom flow boundaries remain the same throughout
      model testing. ????????????????</para>

      <para>In mobile bed models, the water movement and the sediment movement
      have to be reproduced at the same time. The model bed consists of a
      sediment which may be natural or artificial. A diverse range of
      materials have been used in mobile bed models to simulate non-cohesive8
      prototype sediments; amongst other materials, they include sand, grains
      of coal, crushed walnut shells, granulated plastics. Mobile bed models
      are used to investigate erosion, accretion and localised scour
      holes.</para>

      <para>Mobile bed models are considerably more complex than fixed bed
      models, and only some general considerations will be included here. With
      the introduction of a sediment, the specifications for the sediment
      particles in the model need to be decided. If the model sediment grain
      size was simply scaled down according to the length scale, the resulting
      model sediment particles would be so fine that they may well exhibit
      cohesive behaviour, and such a sediment could not be used to simulate
      the behaviour of a non-cohesive, prototype sediment. This problem is
      circumvented by using sediment grains in the model (which are oversized
      compared to the grain size which would be obtained from the length
      scale), but made out of a material which is less dense than sand, for
      example coal or a granulated plastic. By balancing sediment density and
      particle size for the model sediment particles, their fall velocity can
      be scaled according to the velocity scale according to the Froude
      criterion.</para>

      <para>Mobile bed modelling of non-cohesive sediments is far from
      routine. The bed roughness of a mobile bed is a combination of grain
      roughness and bedforms. The size and type of the bedforms (ripples or
      dunes) cannot be specified a priori, but rather are determined by
      interactions between the near-bed fluid dynamics and morphodynamics;
      this includes the turbulence intensity and its distribution, the
      permeability of the bed and the shape of the deformable bed.</para>

      <para>With the introduction of sediment into a model, there is the need
      to establish a morphological time scale which is best based on
      comparisons between the model and prototype bed evolution. This may
      require distortion of the flow scale in the model to achieve</para>

      <para>????????????????? Physical modelling is a specialised area of
      hydraulics investigation. Most physical model studies require judgement,
      experience and compromise; few physical model studies could be regarded
      as routine.</para>

      <para>The motion of the sediment in the prototype is a mixture of
      suspended sediment and bed load. While the suspended sediment moves at
      approximately the flow velocity, the bed load travels much slower. The
      simulation of sediment movement which consists of nearly all suspended
      load or nearly all bed load is easier than the much more difficult
      problem of modelling the total sediment load which consists of
      comparable proportions of both suspended and bed load. It is possible
      also, that the proportions of bed load and suspended load vary with
      time, such as during a flood hydrograph. When this happens, the
      sedimentation time ?? scale will also vary with time.</para>

      <para>In connection to physical modelling, the comment or question is
      often raised in which physical modelling is referred to as an art or a
      science?</para>

      <para>Some flow scenarios may involve a combination of free surface flow
      (which required a Froude model) and pressurised flow (which requires a
      Reynolds model). The resulting scales from applying the Froude and
      Reynolds criteria are in conflict. Therefore, some other solution,
      probably involving some compromises, must be sought in such a
      situation.</para>

          should be well removed from the study area.</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>Model calibration - the model is adjusted so as to reproduce a
          known event, such as a flood, to within an accepted tolerance. If
          the model fails to achieve this, the validity of the model geometry
          should be checked as a first response. Next, consideration should be
          given to the possibility of changes having taken place between the
          time of the recorded event and the time of the bathymetric survey.
          Following on from this, the the roughness of the flow boundaries
          should be adjusted until the event has been successfully simulated
          in the model (p82 [15]).</para>

          <para>Models verification - the performance of the model is further
          checked on another event, which is independent of the data used for
          calibration. While verification is a desirable stage of model
          testing to perform, it is not often carried out due to a lack of
          appropriate data or inadequate funding. In selecting the data for
          both the calibration and verification phases, it good practice to
          use the data from events which are of comparable magnitude to the
          scenarios to be tested. For example, it is not sound modelling
          practice to calibrate a model on a small and frequent event when the
          purpose of building the model is to undertake tests corresponding to
          rare, major events. The reason for this is that the reliability of

    <title>Comparison of Physical and Numerical Modelling</title>

    <para>While the domains of relevance of numerical models and physical
    models have some overlap, there are regions in which either model type is
    more appropriate. Each model type has its own advantages and disadvantages
    and the main ones are summarised in Table 6.</para>

    <para>Apart from numerical and physical models, there is a third category
    of model which is known as a hybrid model which consists of a numerical
    model linked in some way to a physical model ([4]). In hybrid models, the
    focus is on trying to optimise the overall performance of the model by
    using a physical model to simulate those regions or processes in which it
    is more capable and to use a linked numerical model to capture those
    regions or processes best suited to the numerical model. The interaction
    between the numerical and physical components can be one-way or two-way.
    Hybrid models are not common; they require considerable electronic support
    and would only be considered for a major hydraulic investigation and
    carried out by a well-equipped hydraulics laboratory.</para>

    <para>It is noteworthy that some prototype situations are not suitably or
    easily modelled using either model type. Three examples, not included in

        erosion behaviour of clays of differing mineralogical composition are
        not well defined and easy to incorporate into a numerical model. The

    <title>Methods for Calculating Steady State Backwater and Drawdown
    Curves</title>

    <para>Irrespective of whether steady-state flows are subcritical or
    supercritical, there are two well known methods for calculating the water
    surface profiles, be they (i) backwater curves or (ii) drawdown curves. In
    backwater profiles, the water surface deepens in the downstream direction
    and such flows are decelerating flows.In drawdown profiles, the water
    depths become more shallow in the downstream direction and the flows are
    accelerating flows.</para>

    <para>The three main numerical techniques for calculating steady water
    surface profiles are:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>the direct step method,</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>the direct integration method, and</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>the standard step method.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para>A brief comparison of the two methods can be seen in Table 7.</para>

    <para>Since the direct step and direct integration methods are based on a
    first order differential equation, a single boundary condition is required
    to initiate the computations. Suitable boundary conditions could be near
    (but not at) a control where the water level is known or can be
    approximated, or any location, reasonably well removed from any regions of
    rapidly varied flow, where the water level is known.</para>

    <para>If the flow is subcritical, the flow is controlled from the
    downstream end and computations should advance in the upstream direction.
    On the other hand, for supercritical flows, the flow is controlled from
    the upstream end and computations should proceed in the downstream
    direction ([18] and [19]). If these guidelines regarding the direction of
    the solution procedure are not observed, it has been stated ([18] and
    [19]) that the calculations will eventually depart from the true solution.
    This rule-of-thumb is not without contention. There is some evidence which
    suggests that if an implicit finite difference method is employed to solve
    the governing equations, then the direction of computation is immaterial
    ([25]).</para>

      <title>Direct Step Method for Calculating Backwater and Drawdown
      Curves</title>

      <para>In the direct step method for calculating steady state, gradually
      varied flow profiles, the distance between two sections with specified
      depths is calculated.</para>

      <para>The direct step method of calculating gradually varied flow
      profiles is only applicable to prismatic channels (which are more
      commonly manmade than natural). In this method, the flow depths at those
      sections where computations are to be carried out along the waterway are
      known (or specified) in advance. The (specified) depth increments or
      decrements between these sections need not be constant. With the depths
      (y) along the waterway known, the direct step method enables the
      distances between these sections (Δx) to be calculated directly without
      the need for iteration or trial and error. The governing equation is the
      first order ordinary differential equation:</para>

      <para>S<subscript>f 2</subscript> = friction slope at Section 2</para>

      <para>The reason that the direct step method is only applicable to
      prismatic channels is that the unknown in equation (29) is Δx. In the
      case of a subcritical flow, the computations proceed in the upstream
      direction; while x<subscript>2</subscript> will be known (or specified),
      x<subscript>1</subscript> will be unknown<superscript>9</superscript>.
      Unless the section properties at x1 are known, the computation of the
      specific energy and friction slope at this location cannot (in
      principle) proceed. The requirement imposed by the direct step method is
      therefore that the channel be prismatic.</para>

      <para>Since the direct step method is explicit, no iteration is needed.
      The solution of equation (29) is straightforward and easily executed in
      tabular form on a spreadsheet.</para>

      <title>Standard Step Method for Calculating Backwater and Drawdown
      Curves</title>

      <para>The standard step method is more versatile than the direct step
      method in that it can be applied to irregular (usually natural) channels
      i.e. channels with cross-sections which are changing along the length of
      the waterway. The relevant equations for the standard step method are
      based on the definition for total head, the difference in head between
      two sections separated by a horizontal distance Δx, and an expression
      for the friction slope based on the Manning (or Chezy or
      Colebrook-White) equation.</para>

      <para>Figure 17 contains a definition diagram for calculating the
      gradually varied flow water surface profile for a subcritical
      flow.</para>

      <para>In the standard step method, the aim is to satisfy the two
      expressions below [equations (30) and (31)] and this will only happen
      when the correct unknown depth y<subscript>1</subscript> has been
      determined. Because the unknown depth y<subscript>1</subscript> is
      needed for the flow area A<subscript>1</subscript> and the friction
      slope S<subscript>f 1</subscript>, a trial and error process or some
      other iterative technique is needed to arrive at a solution.</para>

      <para>In the case of a subcritical flow, the unknown in equation (36) is
      y<subscript>j</subscript> , while for a supercritical flow, the unknown
      would be y<subscript>j+1</subscript>. Solution of equation (36) requires
      iteration because the Froude number and friction slope on the right hand
      side, require the depth before being able to be evaluated at both
      locations x<subscript>1</subscript> and x<subscript>2</subscript> . The
      direct integration method therefore requires iteration to solve an
      implicit equation.</para>
