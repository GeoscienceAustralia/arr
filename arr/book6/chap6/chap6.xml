      <title>Background and Scope</title>

      <para>Blockage can have a severe impact on the capacity of drainage
      systems, even though there are situations where significant blockage may
      not impact flood behaviour to any great extent. Determination of likely
      blockage levels and mechanisms, when simulating design flows, is
      therefore an important consideration in quantifying the potential impact
      of blockage of a particular structure on design flood behaviour.</para>

      <para>This chapter provides guidance on the assessment of blockage in
      drainage systems to assist in drainage analysis and design for urban and
      rural catchments. While there are a range of locations and conditions
      where blockage of a drainage network may be a concern in hydraulic
      design, this guidance note concentrates specifically on blockage of
      cross drainage structures, in particular culverts and small
      bridges.</para>

      <para>Blockage of drainage structures is a subject where a range of
      advice has been provided in different guidelines. Many drainage
      guidelines do not mention blockage at all, therefore blockage is ignored
      in many cases. In other situations, especially where there has been an
      observed blockage problem in historical flood events, blockage may be
      specified for extreme conditions. Other guidelines provide inconclusive
      advice.</para>

      <para>In fact, the actual evidence for the impact of blockage on design
      flood events is very limited and the evidence for any clear quantitative
      design advice is lacking. This is the case internationally as well as in
      Australia.</para>

      <para>This guideline is not a definitive approach, but is an attempt to
      provide an approach that allows a consistent analysis methodology, while
      not becoming too extreme in either direction since there are risks in
      either under- or over-estimating the influence of blockage. It draws
      heavily on the findings of an earlier report prepared by the ARR Project
      11 team. Materials upon which this guideline has been based are
      referenced in the Bibliography of this guideline and in the earlier
      project reports and papers released on the ARR website (www.arr.org.au
      ).</para>

      <para>It is expected that this guideline will be updated and revised as
      more information becomes available and designers gain experience in the
      assessment of blockage and how it affects the drainage system and
      calculated design flood behaviour.</para>

      <title>Limitations of Procedure</title>

      <para>This procedure has been developed to quantify the most likely
      blockage level and mechanism for a small bridge or culvert when impacted
      by sediment or debris laden floodwater. It has not been developed for
      and is not appropriate when considering the impact of what are known as
      hyperconcentrated flows, mudflows or debris flows, on blockage of a
      structure. Hyperconcentrated flows are typically defined by a solids
      content of 20% or more by volume (or about 40% by weight) of the water
      column. Mud and debris flows include even higher levels of solids. At
      these much higher levels of suspended or fully integrated solids,
      blockage levels are likely to be much higher than those assessed in
      accordance with this guideline. Care should be taken in the review of
      catchment conditions where bed grades are relatively steep (say &gt;
      3%), to confirm bed and banks would remain relatively stable, such that
      flows would remain in the sediment or debris laden category and not
      become hyperconcentrated during the event under consideration.</para>

      <para>While this procedure includes consideration of the impact of
      non-floating (sediment) on blockage of a structure, it is restricted to
      the likely impact of such material arriving at the structure during a
      design event. It cannot reflect the impact of any pre-existing build-up
      of sediment on the subsequent blockage of a structure.</para>

    <title>Types of structures and drainage systems</title>

    <para>The types of structures or drainage elements affected by blockages
    can generally be grouped as follows:</para>

    <orderedlist numeration="loweralpha">
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>Bridges and Culverts: </emphasis>These cross drainage
        structures carry roads, railways, pipelines or other infrastructure
        across watercourses. These structures can be affected by a number of
        different types of blockage mechanisms, resulting in consequences
        including increased flood levels, changes to stream flow patterns,
        changes to erosion and deposition patterns in channels, and physical
        damage to the structure. Blockage of these structures is the subject
        of this guideline.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>Drainage system inlets and pipes:</emphasis> This
        includes components of urban drainage systems located within road
        reserves and urban overland flow paths. Frequently blockage of this
        type of system is generally less likely to cause the same extent of
        damage associated with blockage of bridges and culverts, but the
        consequences can still be serious from a traffic and safety
        perspective, and can cause serious inconvenience and nuisance. However
        in certain circumstances, in densely developed urban areas, pit
        blockage can cause significant monetary damage due to flooding of
        buildings upstream. While this type of blockage can be a significant
        nuisance, it is not covered in this guideline.</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>Open channels and waterways:</emphasis> Blockage of
        natural and constructed waterways can occur at any location, typically
        as a result of large debris snagged against bank vegetation, or debris
        passing slowly down the channel. The consequences of such blockage are
        increased flood levels, diversion of surface flows and the possible
        relocation of the waterway channel as a result of severe bank erosion.
        Blockage of these structures is not covered in this guideline.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>Overland flow paths: </emphasis> This category covers
        various surface flow paths that are not normally recognised as
        drainage channels but do act to convey surface flows in larger events.
        Blockage of these flow paths can result from the deposition of
        sediment or the material blockage of structures built across the flow,
        such as property fences blocked by litter and grass clippings.
        Blockage of these structures is not covered in this guideline.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis>Weirs and dams:</emphasis> Debris can cause blockage
        within the spillways of weirs and dams, especially where there is a
        significant constriction to the flow area. This could increase the
        water level in the storage, possibly threatening the security of the
        structure. The sudden release of large debris rafts from dam spillways
        can cause significant damage to downstream road crossings. Blockage of

      <section xml:id="b6_ch6_s_48lp5">
        <title>Generally</title>

        <para>All blockages that do occur arise from the arrival and build-up
        of debris at a structure. There are three different types of debris
        typically present in debris accumulated upstream of or within a
        blocked structure. This debris may be classified as floating (e.g.
        trees), non-floating or depositional (e.g. sediment) and urban (e.g.
        cars and other urban debris). Debris comprising natural materials is
        discussed in Sections 3.2.2 and 3,2.3 and urban debris in Section
        3.2.4. A means of determining the relevant dimensions of the debris is
        set out in Section 4.4.1.</para>
      </section>

      <section xml:id="b6_ch6_s_an6la">
        <title>Floating Debris</title>

        <para>Floating debris in rural or forested streams is generally
        vegetation of various types.</para>

        <para>Small floating debris, less than 150 mm long, can include small
        tree branches, sticks, leaves and refuse from yards such as litter and
        lawn clippings and all types of rural vegetation. This type of debris
        can also be introduced into a stream by earlier windstorms, bank
        erosion and land mass failures or from seasonal leaf falls. It is
        important to note that this material is available in both urban and
        rural catchments, and is usually available for transportation at any
        time.</para>

        <para>Medium floating debris, typically between 150 mm and 3 m long,
        mainly consists of tree branches of various sizes. This material is
        usually introduced into the flow path by channel erosion undermining
        riparian vegetation or through wind gusts during storms. It can also
        be present as a result of the breakdown of larger floating
        debris.</para>

        <para>sources as for medium floating debris. Transport and storage of
        this material depends on discharge, channel characteristics, the size
        of the drift pieces relative to the channel dimensions, and the
        hydraulic characteristics (depth and slope) of the system. In small
        and intermediate size channels, this material is not easily
        transported and can easily become snagged mid-stream acting as a
        collection point for smaller material (i.e. a debris raft or log-jam).
        Whole trees can be retained within streams by being temporarily
        anchored either to the bed or banks of the stream. Large floating
        debris is usually transported during larger floods or prolonged
        periods of high river-stage where the floodplain is engaged and the
        ability of the debris to become snagged is reduced. This type of
        debris can cause significant problems for both culverts and bridge
        structures.</para>

        <para>Small items of vegetation will usually pass through drainage
        structures during floods, while larger items may be caught in the
        structure. Once larger items are caught, this then allows smaller
        debris to collect on the structure.</para>
      </section>

      <section xml:id="b6_ch6_s_zw09r">
        <title>Non-Floating Debris</title>

        <para>Non-floating debris in rural or forested streams is usually
        sediment of all types.</para>

        <para>Fine sediments (silt and sand) typically consist of particles
        ranging from 0.004 to 2 mm. The deposition of finer clay-sized
        particles is normally a concern in tidal areas, with lower flood
        surface gradients and velocities. This type of debris is either
        transported along the streambed as bed load or within the water column
        as suspended load. Such material is normally sourced from sheet and
        rill erosion, landslip and landmass failures and channel erosion.
        Yield rates for this material can be significantly influenced by the
        conditions of, and changes to, a catchment due to urbanisation and/or
        rural land use practices.</para>

        <para>Gravels and cobbles consist of rock typically ranging in size
        from 2 to 63 mm and 63 to 200 mm respectively. The source of this
        material may be from gully formation, channel erosion, landslips or
        land mass failure although landslips and/or land mass failures of any
        size will likely create hyperconcentrated or even debris flows which
        are not covered by this guideline. Once mobilised, gravels and cobbles
        are primarily transported as bed load within high gradient streams.
        The deposition of cobbles can readily block the entrance of culverts
        or reduce the flow area under bridges.</para>

        <para>Boulders comprise rocks greater than 200 mm. The source of
        boulders is mostly from gully and channel erosion, landslips and the
        displacement of rocks from channel stabilisation works. Like gravel
        and cobbles, this material is typically transported as bed load in
        high gradient streams. This material can readily block the entrance to
        a structure and/or cause damage to the structure from the force of
        impact/collision.</para>
      </section>

      <section xml:id="b6_ch6_s_s0kjo">
        <title>Urban Debris</title>

        <para>Urbanisation of catchments introduces many different man-made
        materials that are less common in rural or forested catchments and
        which can cause structure blockage. These include fence palings,
        building materials, mattresses, garbage bins, shopping trolleys,
        fridges, large industrial containers and vehicles. Garbage bins can
        for example be easily washed down a street and into a stream or
        drainage structure, a situation made worse if a large rainfall event
        occurs on the same day as rubbish collection within the catchment,
        when bins are placed in streets for collection. Urban Debris can be
        floating or non-floating.</para>

      <title>Debris Availability</title>

      <para>In discussing debris availability and mobility, defining the
      source area is an important consideration. The source area is that area
      from which debris could be sourced during an event. In a small event it
      may be restricted to the immediate confines of the creek and its banks
      but in larger events will likely extend to the full extent of the
      floodplain and possibly the full extent of the upstream catchment area.
      As this procedure is used to initially establish debris potential in a
      1% AEP event , the relevant source area will typically be limited to the
      1% AEP flood extents. Steep sided tributaries and larger rills may
      however extend the source area beyond the limits of the 1% AEP
      flood.</para>

          The potential for soil erosion is dependent on a number of factors

          and gradient, vegetation cover and changes in catchment hydrology,

      <title>Debris Transportability</title>

      <para>Once debris has been mobilised, it then needs to be transported
      down the stream if it is to present a hazard to downstream structures.
      Stream power, velocity, depth, presence of snags and bends and the
      overall dimensions of the water course play a large part in determining
      whether the mobilised debris lodges where it first enters the stream or
      is transported downstream to a receiving structure. There is a
      reasonably strong correlation between the waterway width and the maximum
      size of floating debris that a stream can transport. The event magnitude
      is also a major factor in controlling the quantity of debris
      transported. Rarer events produce deeper and faster floodwater able to
      transport large quantities and larger sizes of debris, smaller events
      may not be able to transport larger bridging material at all.</para>
    </section>

    <section xml:id="b6_ch6_s_v0zm7">
      <title>Structure Interaction</title>

      <para>The likelihood of blockage at a particular structure depends on
      whether or not debris is able to bridge across the structure’s inlet or
      become trapped within the structure. As bridging occurs, the clear
      expanse of each opening reduces, thus increasing the likelihood of
      further bridging and further blockage by smaller or similar material.
      Smaller blockage matter is unlikely to cause full blockage of a
      structure without the presence of suitable larger bridging matter, the
      material that initially bridges across the opening or inlet of a
      structure. Bridging matter can be as small as leaves caught on a kerb
      inlet grate, or as large as logs, cars and shipping containers caught at
      a culvert inlet or on bridge piers.</para>

      <para>Exposed services attached to the face of culverts or bridges or
      obstructing the culvert waterway opening can significantly increase the
      risk of blockage. Similarly, some through-culvert features introduced to
      improve fish passage can also collect and hold debris increasing the
      risk of internal blockage problems. Many other factors such as skew
      alignments, opening aspect ratios, opening height to overtopping height
      ratios, culvert hoods, sloping inlet walls and the smoothness of
      transitions can also modify the likely interaction between the arriving
      debris and the bridge or culvert structure</para>

      <para>In urban drainage systems, any individual culvert in the system is
      not an individual structure, it is part of a system, generally with
      culverts and other structures in a series down the water course. As a
      consequence, upstream culverts are likely to collect a portion of the
      transported debris in the stream, reducing the quantity of debris that
      would otherwise reach the downstream culverts so the risk of blockage in
      these downstream structures is reduced.</para>

      <para>While an unquantifiable factor, random chance plays a significant
      role in the blockage of structures. Antecedent conditions can in
      particular substantially alter the likely level of blockage at a
      structure. Recent floods can for example reduce the availability of
      debris but increase the transportability of debris of a particular size
      by cleaning out the waterway. Even the alignment of a limb approaching a
      structure can substantially alter its likelihood of being caught on the
      inlet and triggering a more substantial blockage. Blockage of a
      structure in any event of a particular magnitude will therefore vary in
      response to these random changes in behaviour, creating a distribution
      of blockage levels associated with such an event. This guideline
      attempts to quantify the average or most likely blockage level
      associated with a design event of a particular magnitude, as this
      presents an AEP neutral approach to simulation of the resulting flood
      surface.</para>

    <title>Assessment of Design Blockage Levels</title>

    <section xml:id="b6_ch6_s_uwo8y">
      <title>Overview</title>

      <para>Blockage of cross drainage structures such as culverts and bridges
      could have an impact on the capacity of these structures and also on
      flood levels. Hydraulic analysis of these structures should therefore
      provide for some consideration of these impacts. This section describes
      a procedure for the inclusion of the impacts of blockage in
      analysis.</para>

      <para>The design blockage is the blockage condition that is most likely
      to occur during a given design storm and needs to be an “average” of all
      potential blockage conditions to ensure that the calculated design flood
      levels reflect the defined probability. For example, an assumption of a
      higher than average level of blockage would lead to the calculated
      design flood level upstream of the structure being higher than would be
      appropriate for the defined probability. Downstream flood levels would
      be lower because of the additional flood storage created upstream of the
      structure. On the other hand, an assumed lower than average level of
      blockage would result in lower flood levels upstream and higher flood
      levels downstream. This is a similar concept to that of AEP neutrality
      used in various aspects of design flood event analysis. It is also noted
      that actual blockage levels vary greatly from event to event with a
      potential spread from “all clear” to “fully blocked” even in floods of
      comparable magnitude. Antecedent catchment conditions and pure chance
      are major factors in determining blockage levels in an actual event. The
      selected design blockage must aim for AEP neutrality (the concept of
      ensuring that the average recurrence interval of the design flood
      discharge is the same as the AEP of the design rainfall input) so design
      floods are appropriate for the particular circumstances. As with other
      similar aspects of design flood estimation, such as losses, each
      individual historical flood may have quite different amounts of blockage
      compared to the design event.</para>

      <para>Flood mapping is an exercise in probabilities that involves the
      estimation of ‘average’ catchment conditions for various storm and flood
      frequencies to ensure that the rainfall of the defined probability
      produces a flood event of the same probability. In such work, design
      blockage conditions must be considered when predicting flood levels of a
      given frequency. In situations where the consequences of flooding
      (including the impact of blockage) are high, planning rules typically
      require design for a lower probability (rarer) event. An increase in the
      design event probability is typically adopted for planning purposes,
      when the consequences of flooding are low.</para>

      <para>This guideline is based on a design event type analysis, where a
      flood of a defined flood probability is required. For Monte Carlo
      analysis of flood risk, a probability distribution of blockage is
      required, as an input. Considering the uncertainty in the assessment of
      blockage, analysis of probability distributions is even more difficult.
      This topic is discussed in a little more detail below in Section 5.3.The
      procedure presented in this guideline is based on a qualitative
      assessment of debris likely to reach a structure, and the likely
      interaction between that debris and the structure regarding its
      potential for blockage. It is based on the various papers prepared by
      Barthelmess, Rigby, Silveri and others.</para>

      <para>The procedure initially involves a series of decisions leading to
      estimation of the likely magnitude of debris reaching a structure in a
      1% AEP event and the most likely blockage level that would develop at
      the structure under consideration. Subsequent adjustments are then made
      to reflect the most likely design blockage levels in lesser or greater
      AEP events and to establish the associated most likely blockage
      mechanism. This procedure provides an AEP neutral approach to the
      assessment of an appropriate level of blockage for the simulation of
      design flood behaviour , but may not reflect specific conditions in an
      equivalent historical event. Such is the random nature of the many
      variables controlling blockage behaviour.</para>

      <title>Appropriate Investigation</title>

      <para>It is important to recognise the impact that different levels of
      investigation can have on the confidence associated with any blockage
      estimate. Estimates based on aerial imagery alone cannot for example
      provide the level of confidence that would be obtained from a field
      visit to the site, specifically aimed at assessing the various factors
      influencing blockage levels at the site or likely blockage
      mechanisms.</para>

      <para>Where the target structure/site is located in a particularly flood
      sensitive area and blockage of the structure could significantly impact
      flood behaviour in that area, then a high level of investigation is
      warranted. This should include a field inspection of the upstream
      catchment/source area to confirm the types of debris likely to reach the
      site, their availability, mobility and transportability together with
      the average size of the largest 10% of each debris type likely to reach
      the site. Any structures upstream of the target structure/site should be
      inspected and consideration given to their ability to trap debris
      reaching the target structure/site. Any photographs/records of past
      blockage material and extents should be used to validate the choice of
      L<subscript>10</subscript> and debris type. Although seldom available,
      any photos/records of the blockage mechanism (Location – Type – Timing)
      that have been observed in past events will help to validate the chosen
      blockage mechanism to be used in the hydraulic model. However it must be
      stressed that it is the most likely (AEP neutral) blockage mechanism
      that is required, not the worst case scenario. Flood mapping, aerial
      photography, annual rainfall and rainfall IFD data, rainfall and soil
      erosivity maps, topographic maps, vegetation and soil maps should be
      consulted when available to further consolidate conclusions as to the
      types of debris likely to reach the site and the quantum of such
      debris.</para>

      <para>Conversely, when the structure under consideration is in an area
      where changes in flood behaviour would have no significant consequences
      on safety, property damage or amenity, then an extensive investigation
      to support the blockage assessment process, as outlined above, may not
      be warranted. This decision should be documented.</para>

      <para>The final decision as to what is an appropriate level of
      investigation must ultimately be the responsibility of the person making
      the assessment. It will vary greatly between sites and will to some
      extent be constrained by what information is available. Whatever the
      approach adopted, it is important that the level of investigation
      undertaken should be relevant to the importance of the assessment of
      blockage at the site and is documented, so that others relying on the
      assessment can be aware of the confidence limits attaching to that
      particular assessment.</para>

      <title>Blockage History</title>

      <para>The history of blockages in the drainage system is an important
      input to any risk based approach to blockage, and should always be
      explored in so far as available data permits. While the procedure
      outlined in this guideline provides a generic assessment of likely
      design blockage levels and mechanisms, local observations and history
      can be important in ensuring that this procedure results in reasonable
      answers. All available history should be sought from relevant local
      stakeholders, including residents, in assessing the reasonableness of
      blockage levels and mechanisms produced by this guideline.</para>

      <para>In particular, if there has been no long term history of blockage
      at a particular structure and similar drainage structures in the
      catchment have not demonstrated blockage problems, blockage may not need
      to be considered, or a nominal allowance only may be appropriate in
      design.</para>

      <title>Assessment Procedure</title>

      <section xml:id="b6_ch6_s_ufqp2">
        <title>Debris Types and Dimensions</title>

        <para>In using this procedure it is necessary to first assess the type
        of debris likely to arrive at the structure under review and the
        likely dimensions of that debris. Where more than one type of debris
        is present in quantity in the source area, the procedure will need to
        be repeated for each debris type to establish the debris type with the
        most impact on the performance of the blocked structure.</para>

        <para>The types of debris available in their respective source areas
        will normally be readily apparent during a field visit or from aerial
        photographs, but relevant dimensions may be more difficult to
        assess.</para>

        <para>The ratio of the opening width of structures (e.g. diameter or
        width of the culvert or bridge pier spacing) to the average length of
        the longer debris that could arrive at the site (termed here as
        L<subscript>10</subscript>) is a well correlated guide to the
        likelihood that this material could bridge the openings of the
        structure and trigger a blockage. This L<subscript>10</subscript>
        value is defined as the average length of the longest 10% of the
        debris reaching the site and should preferably be estimated from
        sampling of typical debris loads, If however, such data is not
        available, it should be determined from an inspection of debris on the
        floor of the source area, with due allowance for snagging and
        reduction in size during transportation to the structure.</para>

        <para>For debris of any particular type and size to reach the
        structure, the debris must;</para>

            or without non-floating debris being deposited prior to reaching
            the structure as the stream grade and velocities reduce. For
            smaller more turbulent streams (less than say 6 m bank to bank)
            the width between banks of the stream through the source area will
            normally limit the size/length of larger floating debris to less
            than the stream width. The bed grade immediately upstream of the
            structure will normally limit the size of the larger non floating
            debris reaching the structure to that capable of being moved by
            the flow.</para>

        <para>Any loose material and pockets of debris lying within or in

        debris that could cause downstream blockage. A detailed inspection of
        the waterway upstream of the target structure, particularly after a
        flood, will assist with assessing the above factors and deriving a

        In the absence of a record of past debris accumulated at the

        <title>Debris Availability</title>

        <para>The availability of a particular type of debris (floating,
        non-floating or urban) in a source area limits the level of that
        particular debris that can be ultimately mobilised and transported to
        a structure. As noted in Section 4.4.1, there may be significant
        quantities of more than one type of debris present in the source area,
        requiring more than one type of debris to be assessed. The
        characteristics of high, medium and low availability are hard to
        quantify, so there is some judgment required in their evaluation.
        Table 1 describes typical source area characteristics and a
        corresponding ranking for the likely availability of a particular type
        of debris in that source area. It should be noted that the
        characteristics included are not exhaustive or presented in any
        particular order. Some will only be applicable in respect to certain
        debris types. They are provided to provoke thought about the factors
        that could be relevant to the level of availability. As this procedure
        is based on a 1% AEP flood (with later adjustment for other AEPs) the
        effective source area is that associated with a 1% AEP event.</para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Barrel Blockage (Non
        Floating)</emphasis></para>

        <para>An alternative blockage mechanism is however possible for
        non-floating material (typically sediment) when this material
        progressively arrives and is deposited at the inlet and in the barrel
        or waterway of the structure. This typically leads to a bottom up
        blockage of both the barrel and inlet to the structure. Blockage in
        this form can arise because velocities through the structure fall
        below the level required to maintain the material in motion or, in
        extreme cases, because the depth of sediment in the bed load is
        sufficient to overwhelm the inlet, leading to sediment with little
        water completely blocking the inlet and filling a substantial
        proportion of the barrel of the structure.</para>

        <para>Table 7a classifies the likelihood of deposition in the barrel
        or waterway based on sediment size and velocity through the structure.
        Using this likelihood of deposition Table 7b then combines the
        likelihood of deposition with the debris potential to provide a most
        likely depositional barrel or waterway blockage level for the
        structure.</para>

        <title>Minimum Opening Height Considerations</title>

        <para>Consideration of likely inlet blockage levels as presented in
        Table 6 assumes that the greatest dimension (length) of debris
        relative to the structures opening width is the dominant factor
        influencing inlet blockages. All debris however has three dimensions
        and a lesser dimension, such as the debris height, could also trigger
        vertical bridging across the opening height if the structure’s opening
        height was substantially less than the structures opening width. In
        the absence of detail data on likely debris geometry, it is
        recommended that structures be designed with a clear opening height of
        at least one third their width to reflect the assumptions inherent in
        this procedure. In an existing structure where the opening height is
        less than one third of the opening width, it is recommended that
        analysis be based on the likely vertical dimension of the debris and
        the vertical opening height of the structure in lieu of the likely
        debris length and horizontal opening width. Unless data is available
        to support the choice of L<subscript>10</subscript> (vertically), it
        should be taken as not less than one half of the assessed debris

        <title>Blockage of Multi Cell/Span Structures</title>

        <para>Limited observation of blockages at multi cell culverts or multi
        span bridges suggests that all cells/spans often do not block to the
        same extent. The main factors influencing this variability appear to
        be the main stream approach alignment and location relative to the
        multiple culverts or spans and the relative width of flow carrying
        debris to the total opening width. These two factors are somewhat
        related as they both influence the uniformity of presentation of
        debris, carried by the flow, to the individual cells or spans.</para>

        <para>Where the main stream width is considerably less than the total
        structure width, it is likely that more debris will be delivered to
        and accumulate at or in the cells/spans falling within the main stream
        width, than at the cells/spans located on the adjacent floodplains.
        This may however not be the case when the mainstream flow is only a
        small proportion of the total flow reaching the structure. In such
        cases the presentation of debris to the multiple cells/spans may
        become more uniform resulting in more consistent levels of
        blockage.</para>

        <para>As an initial guide it is suggested that, where the width of
        that part of the approach flow that is capable of transporting the
        debris under consideration, is comparable with or greater than the
        total width of the structure, then the assessed BDES be applied
        uniformly to all cells/spans.</para>

        <para>Where the width of that part of the approach flow that is
        capable of transporting the debris under consideration is
        significantly less than the total width of the structure, then the
        culverts/spans within the effective transport width be assessed as
        blocked to BDES and those outside of that zone be reduced to half
        BDES. Measurements of observed distributions are however essentially
        non-existent at this time. More information, to permit refinement of
        guidelines for blockage of multiple spans/cells, is needed.</para>

        <title>Assessment of Multiple Structures</title>

        <para>It is fundamental to the consideration of the interaction
        between multiple culverts that any individual culvert/bridge could be
        ‘all clear’ or ‘guideline blocked’ in a design event.</para>

        <para>The question then arises as to what are the ‘likely’ AEP neutral
        combinations of blockage that could occur across a catchment. Clearly
        an ‘all clear’ (Bdes=0) global solution is possible in any event and
        even probable in lesser events. In these lesser events the single site
        Bdes is probably also low so the change in catchment floods behaviour
        between different mixes of sites with Bdes&gt;0 and Bdes=0 may not be
        great. In larger events however substantial differences in flood
        behaviour can be created from different mixes of ‘all clear’ and Bdes
        structures across the catchment. Simple math shows that n independent
        sites with two choices for blockage presents 2n combinations. A
        catchment with 6 interacting culverts therefore could involve 64
        possible blockage scenarios. In analysing these mixes it is therefore
        critical both with respect to AEP neutrality and computation time that
        only likely combinations are considered. Seldom will all structures be
        responding in a truly independent manner. There is unfortunately no
        pre-prepared solution for this problem – all catchments will be
        different. While not a truly AEP neutral approach, modelling all
        structures ‘all clear’ and ‘guideline blocked‘ ensures individual
        structure impacts are properly simulated in the envelope solution
        together with the all-clear impacts. If these scenarios are then
        augmented with ‘likely’ mixtures of clear and guideline blocked
        structures, the resulting flood surface envelope should reasonably
        represent the likely envelope flood surface levels that could be
        reached at any site in the catchment. It should be noted however that
        in any single historic event of a given AEP, the recorded flood
        surface will likely only reach the envelope levels at some locations
        (due to the variability in actual historic blockages).</para>

        <para>As previously noted, where there are multiple structures on a
        contiguous water course, the debris availability will normally reduce
        downstream since debris will be captured by the upstream structures.
        Therefore for downstream structures, the debris availability, as
        defined in Table 1 will normally be reduced.</para>

        <title>Risk Based Assessment of Blockages</title>

        <para>In general, the consequences of a flood event of given
        probability will be used to establish risk in an area or at a site and
        this level of risk will in turn be used to establish the appropriate
        event AEP to be used as the planning event for that particular area or
        site. What this approach does not reflect is the relative uncertainty
        in all of the various parameters influencing design flood estimation.
        With even the most careful approach to the selection of parameters
        like design rainfall intensity, rainfall temporal patterns, stream
        roughness or most likely blockage levels, there is a significant
        likelihood that error in the assessment of these parameters may in
        turn lead to errors in the predicted design flood behaviour.</para>

        <para>In an event based approach to modelling it is therefore prudent
        to undertake various sensitivity runs to quantify how reasonable
        variation in the chosen parameters could affect the model’s results.
        Where such an analysis generates significant changes in the flood
        surface, it indicates that the parameter creating that change needs
        very careful review to confirm that the value selected was as
        appropriate as available data permits. A sensitivity analysis of
        alternate reasonable blockage levels and mechanisms is therefore
        strongly recommended for design or analysis involving blockages. It is
        recommended that the sensitivity to such a variation in design
        blockage levels be incorporated into analysis by considering both an
        ‘all clear’ and blocked at twice the calculated guideline blocked
        level (max 100% ) scenarios, to identify sites where flood behaviour
        upstream or downstream of the structure is particularly sensitive to
        the adopted design blockage level. Where such a site is identified,
        all inputs into the assessment process should be carefully reviewed to
        confirm the adopted design blockage level before proceeding with
        design or analysis based on that level.</para>

        <para>As blockage of a structure with significant upstream available
        flood storage can lead to a reduction in flood flow and levels
        downstream of the structure, effectively protecting downstream
        properties, it is important to review the all clear analysis to see if
        the all clear scenario results in significantly increased flows
        downstream of the structure. If this is found to be the case then the
        all clear and guideline blocked results should be enveloped for design
        flood estimation purposes.</para>

        <para>In reviewing risk, inclusion of blockage in a Monte Carlo
        analysis is a valuable means of quantifying the impact of blockage on
        uncertainly in the flood assessment process. A distribution of
        blockage values is however needed for Monte Carlo analysis.
        Considering the uncertainty inherent in the factors influencing
        blockage levels and the lack of data in respect to the variation of
        blockage levels over time, it is however difficult to determine a
        suitable distribution. What little has been done on this distribution
        suggests that the probability distribution is likely to be dual peaked
        with the ‘all clear’ and ‘most likely’ values ranking higher than
        adjacent values. Much more data is however needed before these
        characteristics can be confirmed.</para>

      <para>Where blockages have historically been included in analysis or
      design, they have often been applied as a reduction factor to the
      all-clear flow through the structure. This is a simple and rapid means
      of making some allowance for blockage and in the absence of information

      at a structure based on assessable catchment and structure parameters

      structure. Given this information, a more deliberate approach to
      hydraulic analysis of design blockages is now available, although most
      current hydraulic modelling software currently lacks the functionality
      to simulate the blockage mechanisms described in this document. It is

      <title>Blockage Types</title>

      <para>As previously noted, a blockage mechanism can be described by its
      type, its location and its timing and extents. With respect to type,
      there are three types of blockages that could occur.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">A top down blockage </emphasis>occurs, when
      a floating debris raft builds up at the entrance to a structure,
      obstructing the inlet. This is a very dynamic type of blockage with the
      raft volume and elevation varying over time. These changes occur in
      response to both the flow rate and the difference between debris being
      added and lost from the raft as the blockage develops. On the flood
      recession this material may settle to fully block the inlet even though
      the inlet may have been only partly blocked by the raft at the flow
      peak. While rarely available, the temporal history of such a blockage,
      in an historic event, can be an important factor in realistically
      reproducing the actual flood behaviour at the blocked structure. While
      top down blockages are common in heavily vegetated areas, realistic
      simulation of this form of blockage is very complex.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">A bottom up blockage</emphasis> occurs, when
      non floating material is deposited at the inlet and/or in the barrel or
      waterway of the structure. This also is a dynamic type of blockage with
      sediment being both added and removed from the blockage as time passes.
      Because of the dynamic nature of this process, the debris apparent at
      the conclusion of the event may have little relationship to the debris
      level at any point in time during the event. As with the top down
      blockage, the temporal history of blockage in an historic event can be
      important in realistically reproducing actual flood behaviour during the
      event. Bottom up blockages are relatively common in steep lightly
      vegetated catchments with unstable stream banks or easily eroded stream
      beds. As the geometry of a bottom up blockage does not directly vary
      with flood stage (as in a top down blockage), hydraulic analysis of a
      bottom up blockage is more straightforward.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">A porous plug blockage</emphasis> typically
      occurs when larger vegetative debris (often rapidly) bridges across the
      inlet of the structure covering the entire inlet but with sufficient
      porosity to allow some flow through the plug. It typically arises from a
      rapid bank or slope collapse, releasing a substantial pulse of
      vegetation and sediment into the stream. Unlike a top down or bottom up
      blockage, the porosity of this plug will likely only diminish as the
      event continues, with ever finer material being trapped on the bridging
      material that triggered the initial blockage. As blockage geometry does
      not vary with flood stage (as in a top down blockage), hydraulic
      analysis of a porous plug blockage is also more straightforward.</para>

    <section xml:id="b6_ch6_s_duiq5">
      <title>Blockage Mechanisms</title>

      <para>While the number of possible blockage mechanisms is considerable,
      there appears to be a strong correlation between the dominant debris
      type arriving at a structure and the blockage mechanism it triggers.
      This correlation forms the basis of Table 8 where the blockages ‘most
      likely’ location, timing and extents are described. It should be noted
      that this table is based heavily on limited observations and should be
      updated as further data becomes available.</para>

      <para>Progressive floating raft inlet blockages are assumed in this
      guideline to significantly impact flow through the structure only after
      the flow peaks (being mostly clear at higher flows as the raft lifts
      clear of the inlet and possibly overtops the structure. Pulse like
      blockages of floating material at an inlet mostly arise from vegetation
      injected into the stream from collapsing banks, as floodwater rise or
      from litter swept off the floodplain as streams overtop their banks.
      Neither of the above blockages is likely to create a significant
      barrel/waterway or outlet blockage although non floating debris, if
      present in any quantity can build up under the raft at the inlet and in
      the barrel, particularly as the flood recedes. It should be noted that
      factoring of all clear flow will not necessarily provide a good estimate
      of the impact of either of these mechanism as both are inlet control
      mechanisms and the all clear structure could be operating under strong
      outlet control.</para>

      <para>Non floating material reaching a culvert or bridge will mostly
      build up progressively but can occur as a pulse of debris in streams
      with unstable banks. Typically, non-floating material (sediment) will
      build up throughout the structure (inlet, barrel and outlet) as
      increasing flows mobilise ever increasing amounts of bed and bank
      material. Material will be continuously lost from the accumulated debris
      mass, but the rate of supply is likely to exceed the rate at which
      material passes on downstream, at least while flows are increasing and
      new material is being mobilised.</para>

      <para>These observations and assumptions on the likely type, location
      and timing of a blockage are summarised in Table 8 In this table, the
      following designations are used to describe the timing of key trigger
      points in the blockage process.</para>

      <para>T<subscript>TOTB/SA</subscript> Is the time when flow that first
      overtops the stream’s banks in the source area reaches the

      <para>As previously noted in Section 5.2, modelling the hydraulics of a
      progressively accumulating floating raft is quite complex as the
      blockage is not fixed in regard to its own geometry or in relation to
      the structure’s opening geometry. While applying a blockage
      progressively from T<subscript>P</subscript> to
      T<subscript>OBV/FL</subscript> provides a reasonable approximation of
      when a floating blockage most impacts flow through a culvert or bridge
      that overtops, it does not sensibly reflect behaviour when floodwater
      carrying floating debris does not reach the obvert of the structure. In
      the absence of any better information it is recommended that a
      progressive top down blockage by floating debris that does not reach the
      structures obvert be initiated at T<subscript>OTB/SA</subscript> and
      ramped up to B<subscript>DES</subscript> at T<subscript>P</subscript>.
      It should also be noted that a floating raft creates a top down blockage
      only as a consequence of the projection of floating debris below its
      water surface Relative to the structures opening height this projection
      will lift on the rising limb and fall on the falling limb creating a
      quite variable level of blockage of the structure itself during the
      event. Under such circumstances, blockage levels of the structure will
      be controlled by both the water depth and projection of the raft below
      the water level. Detailed simulation of such a process is however
      considered beyond the scope of this document. This guideline assumes
      that a top down blockage will be simplistically modelled by lowering the
      obvert of the structure over the tabulated time to then reflect the
      tabulated blockage level. Where the consequences of this form of
      blockage are high, and more realistic simulation is deemed necessary, it
      may be necessary to develop a site specific procedure. More information
      on this process can be found in Parola (2000), US DOTFHA (2005) and USGS
      (2013).</para>

      <para>While the temporal pattern of a structure’s blockage when it
      blocks prior to the flood peak in a system with little flood storage
      will have minimal impact on downstream peak flows or upstream peak flood
      levels, it can substantially alter the duration that upstream flood
      levels are above a target (floor or structure overtopping) level. In a
      system with significant flood storage, the timing of a structure’s
      blockage can significantly alter upstream peak flood level, downstream
      peak discharge and overtopping duration. Consideration of the temporal
      pattern of a blockage can therefore be extremely important in
      realistically simulating the hydraulic impact of a blockage.</para>

      <para>In establishing the key timings referred to in Table 8, it will
      normally be necessary to first run a simulation with estimated blockage
      levels and timings in place.</para>

      <para>In an historic event, hydraulic analysis will need to reflect (as
      far as available data permits) the actual blockage mechanism that
      developed at the structure during the event. It should be noted that
      this may vary significantly from what this guideline provides as the
      ‘most likely’ blockage scenario for the structure, such is the impact of
      near random chance on the many parameters influencing actual blockages.
      However, where data for multiple historic events is available and
      blockages appear to consistently differ from these guidelines
      recommendations, further investigation is warranted, with historic data,
      if of reasonable quality, being given precedence.</para>

      <para>Even though floodway crossings can be subject to blockage issues,

          obvert, and also minimises the risk of a person drowning if swept

      <para>Debris control structures or traps are structural measures
      provided in a watercourse i upstream of critical structures to collect
      debris before it reaches the structure and causes problems. These can be
      (a) fences, posts or rails providing a much larger ‘interception area’
      for debris than a pipe or culvert entrance, (b) storages or dry basins
      in which boulders or other debris can collect, or (c) diversion
      structures designed to provide safe bypass of debris or water. Such
      structures can occasionally be incorporated into a water quality
      management plan for a catchment.</para>

      <para>Where debris control structures or at-source control measures have
      been implemented, these should be incorporated into the assessment of
      the drainage system, which could mean a reduction in the allowance that
      needs to be made for blockage. Ongoing maintenance is however
      fundamental to the successful operation of these measures, Unless a
      deliberate maintenance program is in place and has been demonstrated to
      work, it would not be prudent to lower design blockage levels.as a
      consequence of such works.</para>

      <para>Care should also be taken to ensure that the hydraulic impact of

    <title>Conclusion</title>

    <para>The inclusion of blockage in the analysis of hydraulic structures in
    drainage systems is an important consideration in the realistic simulation
    of flood behaviour. The impact of blockage is however a complex and
    difficult problem to analyse.. It is important to ensure that the estimate
    of blockage used in analysis is AEP neutral and not over or
    under-estimated as this can influence the performance of the total system.
    This guideline has presented an approach to the assessment of design
    blockage that has been developed in consultation with Australian experts
    and provides a consistent and logical approach to assist in the effective
    planning and design of drainage systems. Future investigation will refine
    this approach.</para>
