    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>Floods in estuarine areas can be caused by runoff generated by an
    extreme rainfall event, an elevated ocean level generated by a storm surge
    together with a high astronomical tide, or a combination of both processes
    occurring simultaneously or in close succession. Research in Australia
    [<emphasis>Zheng et al. </emphasis>2013] and internationally
    [<emphasis>Svensson and Jones</emphasis>, 2002; 2004; <emphasis>Hawkes and
    Svensson</emphasis>, 2006] has shown that extreme rainfall and storm surge
    processes are statistically dependent, and therefore their interaction
    needs to be taken into account for areas affected by both
    processes.</para>

    <para>This chapter describes procedures that can be used to estimate
    design flood levels in the “<emphasis role="bold">joint probability
    zone</emphasis>”, defined as the region in which the dependence between
    fluvial and ocean processes has the potential to influence the design
    flood level. This region is illustrated in <xref
    linkend="b6_c5_f_uz7q9"/>, and shows that the range of possible flood
    levels are enclosed in an envelope bounded by cases where fluvial floods
    and ocean levels are perfectly dependent (upper curve) and independent
    (lower curve).</para>

    <para>This chapter provides practical guidance on estimating flood risk in
    the joint probability zone. The focus of this chapter is on the “design
    variable method”, which has been developed as an approach to estimate
    flood risk that is applicable across Australia's diverse climates. The
    method has been tested for design floods with annual exceedance
    probabilities between 50% and 1%, and the method can account for climate
    change influences by adjusting both the design rainfall and design ocean
    levels that are required as inputs.</para>

    <para>The theory and practice of flood estimation in the joint probability
    zone is considerably more complex than many traditional fluvial flood
    estimation problems, and engineering judgement is required on whether the
    design variable method described in this chapter is suitable for a given
    situation. This judgement should be based on a sound knowledge of joint
    probability theory, combined with an understanding of fluvial and oceanic
    flood processes. Alternative methods that may be appropriate under certain
    conditions are discussed briefly in <xref
    linkend="b6_c5_s_eacb1"/>.</para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Rainfall:</emphasis> A flood can be
        initiated by a sustained burst of intense rainfall (often referred to
        as a storm burst, shown in <xref linkend="b6_c5_f_omn8v"/> as the
        shaded four hour period) over an estuarine catchment. This storm burst
        can be characterised by its duration, spatial extent, temporal pattern
        and intensity. The storm burst is often embedded in a longer period of
        rainfall, which can be caused by large-scale meteorological features

        to contribute runoff at the catchment outlet, and is often assumed to
        be equivalent to the time taken for water to travel from the most
        distant point in the catchment to the catchment outlet. The time of
        concentration of the hypothetical catchment in <xref

        anomalous wind and atmospheric pressure that are linked to large-scale
        weather patterns, and the magnitude of the surge at a particular

      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>As illustrated in<emphasis role="bold"> </emphasis><xref
    linkend="b6_c5_f_omn8v"/>, the question of whether or not a large fluvial
    flood will coincide with an elevated ocean level will depend on several
    timing issues, which are influenced by a combination of meteorological,
    catchment-scale and oceanographic processes. In particular, the timescale
    of both rainfall and storm surge events are determined by meteorological
    influences, whereas the timescale of the runoff depends on specific
    catchment features that are related to the catchment’s time of
    concentration.</para>

    <para>A further complicating factor is that the same meteorological events
    can drive both rainfall and storm surge events, and this has led to the
    finding in Australia [<emphasis>Zheng et al.</emphasis>, 2013] and
    internationally [<emphasis>Svensson and Jones</emphasis>, 2002; 2004;
    <emphasis>Hawkes and Svensson</emphasis>, 2006] that extreme rainfall and
    storm surge is statistically dependent. The dependence strength between
    extreme rainfall and storm surge in Australia was found to vary as a
    function of geographic location and the duration of the storm burst
    [<emphasis>Zheng et al.</emphasis>, 2013; <emphasis>Zheng et
    al.</emphasis>, 2014a]. Each of these factors will need to be taken into
    account when selecting a method for flood risk estimation in Australia's
    estuarine catchments.</para>

  <section xml:id="b6_c5_s_eacb1">
    <title>Flood risk estimation approaches for the joint probability
    zone</title>

    <para>Several approaches have been developed to estimate flood risk in the
    joint probability zone, each with different assumptions, data and
    modelling requirements. The three most commonly used approaches are
    described here. A comparison between each approach is provided in <xref
    linkend="b6_c5_t_fewui"/>.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Flood Frequency Analysis (FFA):
    </emphasis>This approach involves fitting a probability distribution to
    time series of historical streamflow. The approach is relatively easy to
    implement, but requires long, high-quality historical flood records at the
    location of interest. The advantage of this approach is that, by directly
    focusing on the statistical characteristics of historical floods, it may
    be possible to avoid modelling the complex processes that lead to
    estuarine flood risk as depicted in <xref
    linkend="b6_c5_f_omn8v"/><emphasis role="bold">.</emphasis></para>

    <para>However, the approach assumes that the upstream catchment conditions
    and the bathymetry of the estuary are unchanged over the historical record
    and are reflective of future conditions, and that the statistical
    characteristics of the upper and lower boundary conditions (e.g. extreme
    rainfall, sea level, storm surge) will remain constant into the future.
    For most of Australia's estuarine catchments, one or more of the
    assumptions underpinning FFA will be violated; therefore this approach is
    unlikely to be practically applicable in most situations.</para>

    <para>Further information on implementation of flood frequency approaches
    is provided in<emphasis role="bold"> </emphasis><xref
    linkend="b3_ch2"/>.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Continuous simulation:</emphasis> As discussed
    in the context of <xref linkend="b6_c5_f_omn8v"/>, floods in the joint
    probability zone can be influenced by a complex set of processes operating
    at a range of timescales, including subdaily variability in tides, storm
    surges and the flood hydrograph from the upstream catchment, superimposed
    on lower-frequency variability at daily, seasonal, annual and interannual
    timescales. In many cases, dynamical features, such as the progression and
    attenuation of tides up the estuary, can significantly influence the flood
    risk profile.</para>

    <para>Continuous simulation approaches aim to simulate these complex
    dynamics, by running continuous hydrological and hydraulic models to
    generate a long timeseries of a response variable (e.g. flood level) that
    can then serve as the basis for flood frequency analysis. To capture these
    dynamics, the models will usually need to be run at fine sub-daily
    timescales. Furthermore, the hydrological and hydraulic model will require
    long continuous observational time series of rainfall (representing the
    upstream boundary condition) and storm tides (representing the downstream
    boundary condition). To estimate flood risk at specified exceedance
    probabilities, it is possible to fit a probability distribution to large
    values of simulated water levels, or alternatively it may be preferred to
    stochastically generate long continuous time series of the forcing
    variables.</para>

    <para>The computational load of continuously running hydrological and
    hydraulic models at the fine time steps required for capturing tidal
    dynamics, while producing long runs required for estimating the risk of
    floods with low exceedance probabilities, is often extremely high.
    Furthermore, in many cases, long historical time series of both extreme
    rainfall and storm tides are unlikely to be available at the location of
    interest. If implemented correctly, continuous simulation is likely to be
    a technically rigorous approach for flood risk estimation in the joint
    probability zone; however the numerous practical challenges have led to
    the development of the design variable method as an alternative approach
    for most flood risk estimation problems along the Australian
    coastline.</para>

    approaches is provided in <xref linkend="b2_ch6"/>.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Design variable method:</emphasis> This
    approach has been developed as a conceptually simpler alternative to
    continuous simulation, without the limiting assumptions of flood frequency
    analysis. The assumptions embedded in the approach are summarised briefly

      <title>Representations of univariate and multivariate extremes</title>

      <para>Extreme value theory focuses on the statistical behaviour of the
      extremes of a random variable. Most of th theory is derived
      asymptotically as one or multiple variables become increasingly extreme,
      however a large body of literature now shows that the theory performs
      well in modelling finite extremes commonly encountered in hydrological
      applications [e.g. see discussion in<emphasis> Coles</emphasis>,
      2001].</para>

      <para>Univariate extreme value theory is now a mature field, and the
      reader is referred to the text by [<emphasis>Coles</emphasis>, 2001] for
      a detailed overview of the theory and practical applications of extreme
      value models. Probably the most well-known representation of univariate
      extremes are “block maxima”, which are the maximum values of a process
      of independent and identically distributed random variables over a
      period of time such as a year. These maxima are commonly modelled using
      a generalised extreme value (GEV) distribution, with the cumulative GEV
      distribution function given as:</para>

      <para>For both univariate representations, the definition of an

      event becomes more complicated in the multivariate context. Four
      characterisations were identified in<emphasis> Zheng et al</emphasis>.
      [2014b], and are summarised briefly below (refer also to the
      illustration in <xref linkend="b6_c5_f_ome2f"/>). For more theoretical
      treatment of multivariate extremes, the reader is referred to

      is a direct analogue of univariate block maxima, but has the limitation
      that the component-wise maxima may occur at different times in the
      block. As such, the joint maxima will not necessarily correspond to
      “real” (i.e., simultaneously occurring) events. This representation is
      also very wasteful of data, as only the maximum values in each block
      contribute to the analysis. In practice these are severe limitations,

      Similar to the point process representation, this characterisation
      models the situation where both margins are extreme as well as the
      situation where only a single margin is extreme.</para>

      <para>The decision of how to represent multivariate extremes can have
      important implications in the context of flood risk estimation in the
      joint probability zone, with different models potentially leading to
      different estimates of flood risk. In particular, given that the
      dependence between extreme rainfall and storm surge is generally
      statistically significant but not very strong (see <xref
      linkend="b6_c5_s_expsz"/> below), it is necessary to assess the
      probability of floods for situations when only a single variable is
      extreme, as well as when both variables are extreme, suggesting that the
      point process and conditional representations may be most suitable for
      coastal flood risk problems.</para>

      <para>A detailed study in <emphasis>Zheng et al.</emphasis> [2014b]
      compared the three methods illustrated in <xref
      linkend="b6_c5_f_ome2f"/>, with results summarised in <xref
      linkend="b6_c5_t_j2foy"/>. The conclusion of that analysis was that the
      point process representation was most suitable for simulating flood risk
      in Australia's estuarine regions, as the conditional model tended to
      underestimate the dependence strength, and the parameter estimates are
      also highly variable. It was noted, however, that the dependence
      parameter estimates can be biased when simulating extremes using the
      point process representation, and that to overcome this issue it may be
      appropriate to estimate the dependence parameter the threshold-excess
      model. This was the approach taken to develop the map in <xref
      linkend="b6_c5_f_pxwp1"/>, and is discussed in more detail in

      <para>In addition to the large number of alternative definitions of a
      ‘multivariate extreme’ discussed in the previous section, there are also
      a range of statistical models available for simulating extremal
      behaviour of multivariate processes. Five alternative models were
      compared in <emphasis>Zheng et al</emphasis>. [2014b]: the logistic,
      negative logistic, bilogistic, negative bilogistic and dirichlet models
      [see also <emphasis>Kotz </emphasis>and <emphasis>Nadarajah</emphasis>,
      2000]. The conclusion was that the differences in the performance of
      each model were minor. The bivariate logistic model was the simplest and
      most widely used model, and has therefore been recommended for use in
      implementing the design variable method (see <xref

      threshold of the 99th percentile of observed rainfall or storm surge
      data was used, which corresponds to an average of 3.65 exceedances per
      year. Assuming statistical dependence, we would expect on average one
      event every 100 x 100 = 10,000 days to exceed the joint threshold by
      random chance. The actual number of exceedances was then plotted against

      most of the Australian coastline, so that one can expect between eight
      and 27 more exceedances above the joint 99% threshold compared to what
      might be expected by if the processes had been independent. This is a
      significant increase in the potential risk of a ‘joint’ flood event
      (i.e. a flood event caused by the combination of extreme rainfall and
      storm surge), and highlights the importance of accounting for joint
      probability issues in the Australian estuarine zone.</para>

      <title>Illustration of joint probability concepts</title>

      <para>Several of the theoretical concepts of joint probability that were
      described above are now illustrated through a set of joint probability
      problems. The solution to each problem has been derived based on the
      simplifying assumptions of statistical independence or complete
      dependence, which mean that the solutions in the tables below can ach be
      easily verified using hand calculations. For situations with
      intermediate levels of dependence, it is necessary to apply the full
      design variable method to calculate flood exceedance
      probabilities.</para>

      <para>Results are presented in terms of annual exceedance probabilities
      (AEPs) and average recurrence intervals (ARIs), using the conversion AEP
      = 1 – exp( –1 /ARI).</para>

      <para>The probability of two independent events Z = X&gt;x or Y&gt;y:
      Consider two independent random variables, X and Y. What is the
      probability of a ‘failure event’ Z = X &gt; x or Y &gt; y? This type of
      question might arise when (i) a system is considered to ‘fail’ when any
      component of the system fails, and (ii) the failure of any component of
      the system is independent of the failure of any other component. For
      example, a road might ‘fail’ when either of two bridges are overtopped,
      and the bridges are sufficiently far from each other so that we are able
      to assume the flood-producing mechanisms are approximately
      independent<footnote>
          <para>Given that rainfall is a spatial process, the assumption that
          extreme rainfall at two nearby locations is statistically
          independent is unlikely to be valid; it is made here for
          illustration purposes only.</para>
        </footnote>.</para>

      <para>The set of events X&gt;x is shown by the vertical blue lines in
      <xref linkend="b6_c5_f_w3uye"/>, and the set of events Y&gt;y is shown
      by the horizontal blue lines in <xref linkend="b6_c5_f_w3uye"/>. We
      start by considering only the probability of two variables exceeding
      their respective thresholds in a given year (but potentially on
      different days). We turn to the question of calculating the probability
      of the two events coinciding (i.e. occurring at the same time) in a
      later example.</para>

      both variables reach their maxima at the same time within a given
      year.</para>

      <para>This issue can be illustrated by considering the case where we
      assume that the daily maximum storm tide coincides with the daily
      maximum rainfall. This is still a conservative assumption (since the
      peak of the hydrograph will not always occur at exactly the same time as
      the peak of the storm surge within a given day), but less conservative
      than the assumption that the annual maximum of variable <inlineequation>

            <m:mi>X</m:mi>

      <para>The conversation between an AEP and a daily exceedance probability
      (DEP) is DEP=AEP/365. For the example of 1 year ARI event, there is a
      63% chance that any given year will exceed that level (AEP), and a
      corresponding 0.17% chance that any given day will exceed that same
      level (DEP).</para>

    <para>Accounting for dependence between extreme rainfall and storm surge
    as part of estuarine flood risk assessments represents significant
    additional computational effort when compared to traditional univariate
    methods. Therefore, a pre-screening analysis is recommended to determine
    whether the additional complexity of a joint probability analysis is
    warranted.</para>

    <para>The aim of this step is to calculate the outer envelope of flood
    estimates obtained from the joint probability method. This involves
    calculating a minimum number of cases to determine the magnitude of flood
    differences between independence and full dependence: (1) the independence
    case where a fluvial flood occurs in the absence of an ocean event; (2)
    the independence case where a coastal flood occurs in the absence of a
    rainfall event; and (3) the full dependence case where both a fluvial
    flood and a coastal flood occur simultaneously.</para>

    <para>The specific number of runs required in the pre-screening analysis

    reaches of the river. For this case, complete dependence should be
    assumed; the AEP of a flood level is obtained when the same AEP of the
    rain and storm surge are assumed to coincide (red cells). While this is a
    conservative assumption, it eliminates the need for modelling a much
    larger number of combinations.</para>

    <para>The final step of the analysis involves superimposing the flood
    level table (<xref linkend="b6_c5_t_6222v"/>) onto the joint probability
    density function of the bivariate logistic extreme value distribution, and
    in the context of estimating the probability of a specific design flood

        <para>Using the data obtained in Step 3 (<xref

        linkend="b6_c5_t_6222v"/>. The contour of fixed h was illustrated as a
        solid red line in the hypothetical example presented in <xref

        <para>Integrate the bivariate probability distribution function to the
        right of (i.e. above) the design flood level to obtain the exceedance
        probability of that flood event.</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>If the objective of the analysis is to find the design flood level
    corresponding to a specific AEP, then the above steps need to be repeated
    for a number of flood levels until the flood level corresponding to the
    desired AEP is identified.</para>

    <para>A software tool (available from <emphasis role="bold">website
    XXX</emphasis>) has been developed to perform these calculations. This
    tool requires as inputs the dependence parameter and the flood level
    table, and will produce a plot of water levels against AEPs.
    Implementation of the software is illustrated using worked examples in
    <xref linkend="b6_c5_s_f47d3"/>. At present the software implementation of
    the method has been tested for flood levels with AEPs ranging from 50% to
    1%.</para>

    <para>Finally, a note of caution is required regarding the identification
    of the storm burst duration in Step 2. In that step, it was recommended
    that the storm burst duration was selected based on the time of
    concentration of the catchment, with the reasoning that this would lead to
    the maximum flow rate. Assuming static tailwater levels (which is a
    fundamental assumption of the design variable method; see <xref
    linkend="b6_c5_s_eacb1"/>) and a constant dependence parameter, this would
    be equivalent to the duration that would lead to the largest flood event.
    However, because the dependence parameter depends on duration, it is
    possible that some storm burst duration could result in a lower peak flow
    rate but nonetheless lead to a higher flood level because the peak flow is
    more likely to coincide with the peak ocean level. Therefore, if the
    identified storm burst duration identified in Step 2 is close to a
    threshold between dependence parameters, it may be necessary to test the
    implications of an adjacent duration that with a lower dependence
    parameter (i.e. stronger dependence).</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Accounting for climate
    change</emphasis></para>

    <para>Anthropogenic climate change is likely to adversely impact flood
    risk in estuarine regions, owing to a combination of elevated ocean levels
    arising from increases in both mean sea level and possible changes in
    storm surges, as well as increases in extreme rainfall. Furthermore,
    climate change may result in changes to the frequency and magnitude of
    different types of extreme weather events, which may affect the magnitude
    of dependence between extreme rainfall and storm surge/tide.</para>

    <para>Information on how the dependence between extreme rainfall and storm
    surge/tide may change in a future climate is currently unavailable, and
    therefore guidance on possible changes to the dependence parameters in

    is available, however, on possible changes to both extreme rainfall and
    mean sea level. As an interim measure, it is recommended that estimates of
    the impact of climate change on flood risk in the joint probability zone
    be accounted for as follows:</para>

    possible effect of climate change is that the tidally affected part of a
    river is likely to change (for example, it may reach further upstream due
    to the effects of sea level rise), and this will influence the area
    classified requiring a full joint probability analysis. Therefore the
    pre-screening analysis in Step 1 will also need to be repeated when

        need for additional hydrologic and hydraulic runs, although it is
        possible that additional simulations may still be required for low
        exceedance probability events.</para>

    <title>Worked Example 1 — Hawkesbury/Nepean River</title>

    <para>This worked example illustrates the basic implementation of the
    design variable method and should be read in conjunction with <xref
    linkend="b6_c5_s_expsz"/>. The example demonstrates each of the four steps
    of the method applied to multiple sections of a river reach, and provides
    flood level estimates with respect to location, dependence level and
    AEP.</para>

    <para>The hydraulic and hydrologic models for the Hawkesbury-Nepean system
    were originally developed as part of an Environmental Impact Statement in
    the 1990s for works to upgrade the spillway capacity of Warragamba Dam.
    The study included a detailed analysis of the existing flooding behaviour
    and was carried out by Webb McKeown and Associates [1996]. The outcomes
    were subject to rigorous technical reviews by a range of parties including
    Sydney Water, the then Department of Land and Water Conservation, the
    Bureau of Meteorology and other experts.</para>

    <para>The hydrologic model used was RORB, and the hydraulic model was
    RUBICON. The RORB model was calibrated and then evaluated using historical
    records available for five of the events between June 1964 and April 1988.
    The RUBICON hydrodynamic model software was used to quantify the hydraulic
    aspects of the flood behaviour (e.g. flood levels and velocities). RUBICON
    is a fully dynamic 1D model and uses different elements to simulate
    complex flow over floodplains and through channel systems. The hydraulic
    model covers the entire area from Lake Burragorang to the ocean at Broken
    Bay. The process of calibrating and evaluating the RUBICON model was
    undertaken using recorded information for 11 individual historical events.
    The models were then used to determine design flood behaviour of the
    system. The calibrated RUBICON model of the Hawkesbury-Nepean has been
    maintained by WMAwater (previously Webb McKeown and Associates) since this
    original study and was selected for this project as there is a very high
    flood gradient along the river even though the river is tidal for 140 km
    upstream of the estuary inlet under non-flood conditions.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Step 1: Pre-screening
    analysis</emphasis></para>

    <para>As described in Section 7.5, a pre-screening analysis is recommended
    as a first step to identify whether a full joint probability analysis is
    warranted for the problem being considered. The basis of the pre-screening
    analysis is to assess whether flood levels corresponding to the extreme
    cases of complete dependence and complete independence are sufficiently
    different from each other, which is determined with reference to a
    tolerance threshold.</para>

    <para>Consider the location of Liverpool which is 80km upstream from the
    ocean boundary. Assume that the user specifies a tolerance of 0.1 m for
    the design in question. Assume also that the user is interested in a
    design at the 2% AEP level. Three model runs are required:</para>

    <orderedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Completely dependent </emphasis>— flow
        boundary at 2% AEP and ocean boundary at 2% AEP</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Flow boundary only </emphasis>— flow
        boundary at 2% AEP and ocean boundary at 100% AEP</para>

        boundary at 100% AEP and ocean boundary at 2% AEP</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>The water levels resulting from these three runs are summarised in
    <xref linkend="b6_c5_t_6aoet"/>. For the dependent case, the water level
    is 9.590 m. For the independent case, the water level is obtained by
    taking the highest water level from either the flow boundary only case or
    the ocean boundary only case. For this location, the flow boundary only
    case dominates, and leads to a flood level of 9.537 (m). The difference
    between the dependence and independence cases is 0.053 m, which is within
    the specified tolerance. This implies that this cross section is not
    highly sensitive to the ocean level, and is thus in the “fluvial zone”.
    The fully dependent value of 9.590 m is therefore used as the best
    approximation to the 2% AEP event, without having to implement the design
    variable method. This analysis is only valid for the 2% AEP level, and
    should be repeated for other AEPs if there is interest in analysing other
    exceedance probabilities.</para>

    <para>By repeating the pre-screening analysis at multiple locations along
    a river, the extent of the joint probability zone can be defined. Two
    examples of dependent locations for this case study are Olga Bay and
    Spencer, with 2% AEP model runs shown in <xref linkend="b6_c5_t_2bgwj"/>
    and <xref linkend="b6_c5_t_wa2fd"/> respectively. The difference between
    the dependent and independent cases at both these locations is greater
    than the tolerance of 0.1m, indicating the influence of both boundary
    conditions. At these locations, it is therefore necessary to implement the
    design variable method to determine the 2% AEP water level. In Spencer in
    particular, the difference in flood level based on the dependent and
    independent cases is 0.614 m, suggesting potentially significant
    discrepancies depending on the joint probability assumption at this
    location.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Step 3: Flood level
    modelling</emphasis></para>

    <para>The design variable method requires many combinations of boundary
    conditions. <xref linkend="b6_c5_t_c0k2g"/> and <xref
    linkend="b6_c5_t_zi2j2"/> are examples of the hydraulic response at Olga
    Bay and Spencer, respectively. The design variable method does not require
    the same number of runs for each boundary condition (here there are five
    storm tide cases and 10 flow cases), nor do the marginal probabilities
    have to be identical. Where there is sufficient prior opportunity, the
    marginal probabilities could be selected to be standard values (e.g. 1, 2,
    5, 10, …) but in many instances (as in <xref linkend="b6_c5_t_c0k2g"/> and
    <xref linkend="b6_c5_t_zi2j2"/>), they will be back-calculated from
    existing model runs.</para>

    <para>The hydraulic response table should include runs where the 100%
    exceedance probability of each margin is considered, and there should be a
    wide range of AEPs. The range of AEPs for the margins should include
    events that are rarer than the AEPs being calculated for the water level
    (since, for example, a 1% AEP water level could hypothetically arise from
    the combination of a 10% flow and a 0.1% storm tide). The total number of
    model runs (here 5 x 10 = 50 runs) is likely to be the limiting factor for
    the feasibility of the method (especially where 2D models are used) and
    this will govern the resolution at which the table is evaluated
    [<emphasis>Zheng et al.</emphasis>, 2015].</para>

    contours that have been interpolated from the hydraulic response tables

    <para><xref linkend="b6_c5_f_ezjxc"/> shows the output water levels at the
    two locations. For Olga Bay the best estimate (solid black line) is very
    similar to the independence case. This figure also shows that the
    difference between complete dependence and independence is a function of
    the AEP (AEPs &gt;10% are very similar, but AEPs&lt;10% diverge between
    these two cases). For Spencer, the best estimate lies approximately midway
    between the complete dependence and independence cases. This demonstrates
    that the relationship of <inlineequation>
        <m:math display="inline">
          <m:mi>α</m:mi>
        </m:math>
      </inlineequation> is non-linear with respect to the resulting water

    <para>A longitudinal plot can be generated by repeating the analysis for
    multiple cross sections (<xref linkend="b6_c5_f_620lz"/>). The joint
    probability zone is indicated as the region where the difference between
    the complete dependence and independence cases is greater than the defined
    tolerance. From this figure it is clear that Spencer is situated in the
    middle of this zone, and that Olga Bay – being closer to the ocean
    boundary – is less affected by the joint dependence. The extent of the
    zone also depends on AEP, as the joint dependence is more important for
    more frequent events, and this leads to a longer extent of the zone (e.g.
    compare the range of distance over which there is a noticeable difference
    between dependence and independence cases, for the 10% and 1% AEP
    respectively).</para>

    <title>Worked Example 2 — Nambucca River</title>

    <para>The Nambucca River catchment is located in northern New South Wales.
    Based on work prepared for the Nambucca Shire Council, modelled flood
    levels for combinations of boundary conditions were provided from a Tuflow
    1D-2D hydraulic model [<emphasis>WMAWater</emphasis>, 2013]. The model is
    of the Nambucca River, Warrell Creek and tributaries, and covers a
    catchment area of 1315 <inlineequation>
        <m:math display="inline">
          <m:msup>
            <m:mi>km</m:mi>

            <m:mi>2</m:mi>
          </m:msup>
        </m:math>
      </inlineequation>. The model was calibrated to peak flood survey levels
    (1890-2011) and large historical events (1972, 1977, 2009) recorded at
    gauges located at Barraville, Macksville, Stuarts Island and Utungun.
    Design rainfall data for several locations in the catchment were sourced
    from Manly Hydraulics Laboratory and the Bureau of Meteorology.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Step 1 Pre-screening
    analysis</emphasis></para>

    <para>Model runs for a pre-screening analysis at three different AEPs
    (9.5%, 2% and 1%) are shown in <xref linkend="b6_c5_t_wa2fd"/>. For the
    9.5% AEP the difference is 0.21m, for the 2% AEP it is 0.12m and for the
    1% AEP it is 0.12m. The joint probability effect therefore appears to be
    larger for more frequent events. If a tolerance of <inlineequation>
        <m:math display="inline">
          <m:mi>Ζ</m:mi>
        </m:math>
      </inlineequation>=0.1m was specified for the design, a joint probability
    analysis would be required for each AEP to obtain more accurate estimates
    of the water level corresponding to a specified exceedance
    probability.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Comparison to Flood Frequency
    Analysis</emphasis></para>

    <para>At Macksville there is a long historical record of water levels (121
    years, 1890-2011) and an additional continuous recording gauge covering
    the period 1997-2010 (MHL, upstream of Pacific Highway). With this data a
    flood frequency analysis was conducted independently from the design
    variable method, to provide a comparison.</para>

    <para>The flood frequency analysis was performed using FLIKE software
    (<emphasis>Kuczera</emphasis>, 1999) (see <xref
    linkend="b3_ch2"/><emphasis role="bold"> </emphasis>for further details).
    Of the 121 annual maximum events, 93 were censored below the 2m threshold
    due to the tidally influenced nature of the location, which leaves 28
    uncensored gauged values. Of the 28 values, one value – the largest on
    record – could not be specified precisely but instead was suggested to
    have a range between 3.5m-4m [<emphasis>WMAWater</emphasis>, 2013]. The
    censoring of this observation was specified only as being above 3.5m,
    since the software was unable to specify this value as being within a
    range. This method was the best way to incorporate the largest flood
    level, as based on many trials (fixed 3.5m, fixed 4m, fixed 3.75m, GEV vs
    Gumbel distribution), it was observed that the tail region is very
    sensitive to the assumptions being made. The GEV distribution was selected
    over the Gumbel distribution due to the highly skewed shape of the
    distribution. Further inspection of the data and the location would be
    required to better understand the behaviour of the frequent AEP flood
    levels.</para>

    <para><xref linkend="b6_c5_f_f8ege"/> overlays the design variable method
    results with the results of the flood frequency analysis. The frequency
    analysis is summarised using 90% confidence limits and the expected value
    at each AEP based on 50,000 Monte Carlo samples. Data from the continuous
    recording gauge were not used in fitting the GEV distribution but are
    plotted in <xref linkend="b6_c5_f_f8ege"/> as an alternative source of
    information explaining the frequent AEP flood levels. This gauge shows
    higher flood levels compared to the lower tail of the fitted GEV
    distribution, and these levels are more consistent with the estimates of
    the design variable method.</para>

    <para>Due to the diversity of data sources used by the different methods,
    the comparison in between the flood frequency analysis and the design
    variable method in <xref linkend="b6_c5_f_f8ege"/> is not straightforward,
    but it is nonetheless instructive. It is important to use the GEV
    confidence limits as a backdrop for interpreting the design variable
    method because this reflects the uncertainty in the observed data. After
    accounting for the uncertainty intervals, it is apparent that there is
    some overlap between the two methods for a wide range of AEPs. However,
    for some AEPs the two methods do not wholly agree. With respect to the
    flood frequency analysis distribution, the design variable method:</para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Data accuracy:</emphasis> The censoring of
        the 93 tide gauges has meant that there is significant uncertainty for
        high AEP (low flow) events. Flows from an additional gauge was
        identified by [<emphasis>WMAWater</emphasis>, 2013] (triangles in
        <xref linkend="b6_c5_f_f8ege"/>) but were not included as part of the
        flood frequency analysis, and indicate higher flow events on the left
        tail of the distribution compared to the flood frequency events. These
        events were also more similar to the events from the joint probability
        method.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">AEP of boundary events:</emphasis>
        Observing the flood frequency estimates, it is clear that there is
        significant uncertainty associated with the output of a single
        three-parameter GEV distribution.The joint probability method has two
        distributions associated with the boundary margins (the extreme tides
        distribution and the extreme rainfall distribution) in addition to a
        dependence parameter and the parameters of the hydraulic
        model<footnote>
            <para>The largest source of uncertainty is anticipated to be the
            marginal distribution parameters rather than hydraulic model
            parameters or dependence parameter.</para>
          </footnote>. These are a significant source of uncertainty that is
        not accounted for in the design variable method. Estimating
        uncertainty as part of the design variable method is feasible, but is
        an advanced topic not covered in this chapter.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Hydraulic model:</emphasis> The two
        highest recorded events based on the Macksville gauged data were for
        the 1964 flood event (3.2m, corresponding to a 2.1% AEP event) and the
        1950 event (3.4m, corresponding to a 1.3% AEP event). Both were below
        the ‘complete independence’ case from the joint probability assessment
        (dashed blue line in <xref linkend="b6_c5_f_f8ege"/>), although the
        results from the hydraulic analysis are within the flood frequency
        analysis confidence limits. Further checking of the performance of the
        hydrodynamic model with reference to those historical events would
        better inform this comparison and indicate whether the hydraulic model
        has good performance for this location and range of events.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para><emphasis role="bold">Design variable method assumptions:
        </emphasis>The design variable method has a number of assumptions that
        have been discussed elsewhere in this chapter. Attempts to reconcile
        discrepancies between methods could also take these issues into
        account. Note that the discrepancies in <xref
        linkend="b6_c5_f_ydulq"/> are equally observed with both the
        independence and complete dependence cases, so the issue is more
        likely to be due to the assumed marginal distributions and the
        performance of the hydraulic model rather than the joint dependence
        model (which can only vary between these two extreme cases).</para>
      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>

    <para>From this example, it is clear that care is required when
    interpreting the results from the design variable method, and that the
    uncertainty of data sources and model assumptions at all stages of the
    process – both for the flood frequency analysis and for the design
    variable method – should be taken into account.</para>

    <para><emphasis role="bold">Consistency of flood level
    table</emphasis></para>

    <para>The flood level table for Macksville was constructed from output
    from a 2D model. At other locations the flood level table may be only
    partially complete because some flow/tide combinations do not cause the
    water level to exceed the base elevation of that grid cell. As an example,
    <xref linkend="b6_c5_t_kle7b"/> presents a water level table from a
    different location, and has a number of NA values indicating that for
    these combinations the free water surface was not high enough to wet the
    grid cell. Provided that there are not too many NAs and they are in a
    consistent block, the design variable method can handle partially wetted
    flood level tables by ignoring the region of missing values.</para>

    <para>Another issue is that the hydraulic model output should be ‘well
    behaved’ for all combinations of boundary conditions. This issue can be
    seen in <xref linkend="b6_c5_t_kle7b"/> for the column of 0.05 % AEP storm
    tide, which shows two instances where a larger rainfall value results in a
    lower water level. When a rarer rainfall (or, equivalently, storm tide)
    event yields a lower water level this is referred to as being
    non-monotonic increasing. Strictly, this is not physically possible, but
    could be produced by a model for various reasons. One explanation is that
    the hydraulic model itself has spurious numerical artifacts.</para>

    <para>Another explanation is cases where the boundary conditions have been
    derived inconsistently. For example, the user may have switched between
    critical durations, used different temporal patterns or changed the way
    hydrographs are derived from tributary catchments. A practical workaround
    is to enforce monotonicity by artificially raising the water levels to be
    at least as high as water levels from more frequent events (in <xref
    linkend="b6_c5_t_kle7b"/>, the two events would be set to be
    10.44m).</para>

    <title>Asymptotic dependence or independence?</title>

    <para>Flood risk estimation is often concerned with understanding the
    behaviour of the upper tail of a probability distribution. In the context
    of multivariate extremes, this requires assumptions about how the
    dependence between variables changes as the variables become increasingly
    extreme.</para>

    <para>Multivariate probability distributions can be classified based on
    how they behave in the limit as each variable becomes increasingly extreme
    [see <emphasis>Coles</emphasis>, 2001 for additional coverage of the
    theory of asymptotic dependence]. Examples of an asymptotically
    independent and an asymptotically dependent distribution are given the
    figure below: the dependence between variables for the Gaussian
    distribution decreases with extremity of <inlineequation>
        <m:math display="inline">
          <m:mi>X</m:mi>
        </m:math>
      </inlineequation> or <inlineequation>
        <m:math display="inline">
          <m:mi>Y</m:mi>
        </m:math>
      </inlineequation> (evidenced by the increased scatter of points away
    from the leading diagonal), where dependence remains high for the
    asymptotically dependent bivariate logistic distribution.</para>

    <para>A detailed study along the Australian coastline [<emphasis>Zheng et
    a</emphasis><emphasis>l.</emphasis>, 2013] found that at most locations,
    the bivariate distribution between extreme rainfall and storm surge was
    asymptotically dependent, meaning that rarer events are more likely to
    occur jointly compared to more frequent events. This is the basis for the
    recommendation to use a bivariate logistic distribution for dependence
    analysis, and provides a cautionary note for using correlation-based
    measures (which assume Gaussianity) for representing joint
    dependence.</para>
