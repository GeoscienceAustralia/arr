              <title>Objectives and Scope</title>
              <para>Much of Australian Rainfall and Runoff is dedicated to the determination of peak
                     discharge, discharge hydrographs and flood volumes. This chapter deals with
                     translating these discharge estimates into flood levels, flow velocities and
                     the extent of flood inundation needed to determine flood damage and flood
                     hazard. The importance of the inter-relationship between hydrology and
                     hydraulics should not be under-estimated and there is often a blurring of the
                     boundaries between the two areas. For example, the flood routing used to obtain
                     a flow hydrograph and shallow flow surface runoff expressions are both founded
                     in hydraulic engineering principles. In recent approaches to urban flooding,
                     rainfall is a direct input to the hydraulic numerical grid hence forcing the
                     hydraulic model to deal with the hydrology and the hydraulics
                     simultaneously.</para>
              <para>The primary objective of this book is to provide a document which provides
                     background information to assist practitioners to carry out calculations or
                     hydraulic investigations related to free surface flows. The needs for such
                     calculations or investigations may be related to floods (inundation levels,
                     concentration of flows to endanger life, the power of flood flows to threaten
                     or impair structural integrity or even wash away structures, and bed level
                     scour), stormwater disposal, water supply distribution systems and sewerage
                     collection systems (the installation of new systems or augmentation of existing
                     systems).</para>
              <para>The present document concentrates on free surface flows. Textbooks are available
                     which cover the basics of open channel flow. The traditional texts in this area
                     are <citation>b6_c2_r37+1</citation> and <citation>b6_c2_r20+1</citation> but
                     more modern books include <citation>b6_c2_r18+1</citation> and
                            <citation>b6_c2_r122+1</citation>. Pipe flow is covered in fluid
                     mechanics textbooks like <citation>b6_c2_r121+1</citation> and
                            <citation>b6_c2_r139+1</citation>. There are numerous journals which
                     publish research dealing with open channel, pipe flow and river flood flows and
                     these include the ASCE - Journal of Hydraulic Engineering, IAHR - Journal of
                     Hydraulic Research and the Journal of Flood Risk Management. Those practicing
                     and working in this area are encouraged to keep abreast of new developments as
                     this is an area that is evolving with increases in computational power.</para>
