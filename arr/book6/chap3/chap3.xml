    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>Hydraulic structures are used to guide and control water flow
    velocities, directions and depths, the elevation and slope of the
    streambed, the general configuration of the waterway, and its stability
    and maintenance characteristics.</para>

    <para>Careful and thorough hydraulic engineering is justified for
    hydraulic structures. Consideration of environmental, ecological, and
    public safety objectives should be integrated with hydraulic engineering
    design. The proper application of hydraulic structures can reduce initial
    and future maintenance costs by managing the character of the flow to fit
    the environmental and project needs.</para>

    <para>Examples of hydraulic structures include flow measurement
    structures, transitions, constrictions, channel drops, low-flow checks,
    energy dissipators, bridges, bends, and confluences. Their shape, size,
    and other features vary widely for different projects, depending upon the
    discharge and the function to be accomplished. Hydraulic design procedures
    must govern the final design of all structures. These may include model
    testing for larger structures when the proposed design requires a
    configuration that differs significantly from known documented guidelines
    or when questions arise over the character of the structure being
    considered.</para>

    <para>This review is necessarily abbreviated because the general field of
    hydraulic structures is vast. Attention herein is focused on some of those
    structures of most importance in the urban and rural setting. For this
    reason such structures as large dams and spillways are not considered.
    Hydraulic structures covered include flow measurement structures,
    culverts, bridge waterways, rock chutes, and rock riprap. The review
    concludes with a discussion of physical modeling and its particular
    application to hydraulic structure design.</para>

      <title>Introduction</title>

      <para>Sharp-crested weirs are often used to measure flow in open
      channels. Among their advantages, are that they are easy to install,
      accurate, and relatively inexpensive.</para>

      <para>They do, however, have a major disadvantage in flows containing
      substantial amounts of sediment, in that they trap sediment and other
      solids behind them, leading to putrescible deposits in sewer
      applications. For this reason, sharp-crested weirs are most commonly
      used with relatively clean effluent, or in temporary flow monitoring
      locations.</para>

      <para>The emphasis in this sub-section is on the analytical techniques,
      weir properties, and choice for particular purposes, and submergence
      characteristics. In particular, complete details on variations in
      discharge coefficient are not given, and the reader is referred to
      specialist texts for such information.</para>

      <title>Rectangular Sharp-Crested Weir</title>

      <para>The analysis of the sharp-crested weir is best illustrated by
      reference to a weir comprising a vertical plate mounted at right-angles
      to the flow. This represents the so-called “rectangular sharp-crested
      weir”.</para>

      <para>The flow over such a weir is illustrated schematically in <xref
      linkend="b6_ch3_f_i7egf"/>. This figure includes also the necessary
      nomenclature for the analysis. Before proceeding with the analysis, some
      comments are provided on the flow situation.</para>

      </figure>

      <para>It is noted first that the pressure distribution at the weir crest
      is non-hydrostatic. This situation arises because the pressure at both
      Points A and B is atmospheric by definition, and there are significant
      vertical components in the velocity as the flow contracts to pass over
      the weir crest.</para>

      <para>Secondly, it is noted that, as expected, the total energy line
      (TEL) is situated an elevation <inlineequation>

      magnitude of the approach velocity head may be considered to be
      negligible. For simplicity, this is assumed in the following analysis,
      although the influence of the approach velocity head will be included
      later.</para>

      <para>Two further assumptions are utilised for simplicity:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>The flow does not contract as it passes over the weir – i.e.
          the elevation of A is the same as that of the upstream water
          surface.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The pressure is atmospheric across the whole section
          AB.</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>With reference to<xref linkend="b6_ch3_f_i7egf"/>, these
      assumptions lead to an expression for the velocity at C of:</para>

      <title>Broad-crested Weirs and Long-Throated Flumes</title>

      <para>Because critical flow represents a unique relationship between
      depth and flow rate, devices which induce critical flow are often used
      to measure flow in open channels. Most of these devices, however,
      require calibration in the laboratory because the flow characteristics
      are not in accordance with the usual theoretical assumptions.</para>

      <para>Chief among these is the assumption that the pressure distribution
      is hydrostatic. In many devices, the strongly curved stream lines negate
      this assumption, resulting in the necessity for empirical
      coefficients.</para>

      <para>The broad-crested weir and the long-throated flume are devices for
      which the flow rate can be predicted theoretically without the need for
      such coefficients. The broadness of the crest and the length of the
      throat are such that the stream lines are close to horizontal in the
      region of critical flow, permitting the assumption that the pressure
      distribution is hydrostatic.</para>

      <para>The analysis of both the broad-crested weir and the long-throated
      flume is identical in that both rely on the determination of the
      relationship between the upstream water level (which may be measured)
      and critical depth within the constricted section – which is a known
      function of the flow rate. Thus, a unique relationship between flow rate
      and the upstream water surface elevation can be determined.</para>

      <para>Broad-crested weirs are more prone to sediment buildup than
      long-throated flumes and are, consequently, less common in sewerage
      systems. For this reason, the emphasis in the following is on
      long-throated flumes, while recognising that broad-crested weirs are
      analysed in the same manner.</para>

      <para>The long-throated flume is widely used in sewerage systems, within
      the pipe system and to monitor open channel inflows and outflows at
      sewage treatment plants.</para>

      <para>In this section, the advantages of this type of structure are
      first discussed. The derivation of the theoretical rating curve is then
      presented for the rectangular flume and it is shown how this can be
      generalised for arbitrary cross-section shape. Their use in practice is
      then illustrated.</para>

      <para>The primary advantages of these devices are listed in the
      following:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Provided that critical flow occurs in the throat, a rating
          table can be calculated with an error of less than 2% in the listed
          discharge. This can be done for any combination of a prismatic
          throat and an arbitrarily-shaped approach channel.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The throat, perpendicular to the direction of flow, can be
          shaped in such a way that the complete range of discharges can be
          measured accurately, without creating an excessive backwater
          effect.</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>The head loss across the structure required to obtain
          undrowned flow conditions is minimal, and can be estimated with
          sufficient accuracy for any of the structures placed in any
          arbitrary channel.</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>Field and laboratory observations indicate that the structures
          can be designed to pass sediment transported by channels with
          subcritical flow. It should be noted, however, that excessively high
          sediment loads or significant reductions in the velocity of the
          approach flow may create sedimentation problems.</para>

          <para>Provided that its throat is horizontal in the direction of

      <title>Disadvantages</title>

      <para>The major property of a long-throated flume is that it is designed
      to create a constriction in the flow area sufficient to produce critical
      flow over the full range of expected flow rates. In addition, the head
      loss across the structure should not be excessive and afflux should be
      kept to a minimum.</para>

      <para>A typical long-throated flume is shown schematically in <emphasis
      role="bold"><xref linkend="b6_ch3_f_zo82l"/></emphasis>. With regard to
      the hydraulic characteristics of the flume itself, five components may
      be recognised as follows:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>The approach channel, where the flow should be stable so that
          the water level and the energy level can be accurately
          determined.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>A converging transition region into the throat, which is
          designed to provide a smooth acceleration of the flow with no
          discontinuities or flow separation. The transition may be rounded or
          consist of plane surfaces.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The throat, where the flow is accelerated to the critical
          condition. The throat must be horizontal in the flow direction, but
          can, in principle, be of any shape transverse to the flow. The
          invert of the throat may be higher than the invert of the upstream
          and downstream channels.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>A diverging transition to reduce the flow velocity to an
          acceptable level and to recover head. If there is ample available
          head, an abrupt transition may be used.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The tailwater channel in which a known hydraulic control is
          exercised by the downstream conditions and the hydraulic properties
          of the channel.</para>

      <title>Uncertainty in Flow Measurement Structures</title>

      <para>No measurement is perfectly accurate or exact. Many instrumental,
      physical and human limitations cause measurements to deviate from the
      "true" values of the quantities being measured. We refer to these
      deviations as "uncertainties," although, more commonly, the shorter word
      "error" is used. In this review we will continue to use the word
      "uncertainty” since it is a more accurate descriptor</para>

      <section xml:id="b6_ch3_s_t94wf">
        <title>Systematic and Random Uncertainty</title>

        <para>Generally, uncertainties can be divided into two broad and rough
        but useful classes: systematic (or determinate) and random (or
        indeterminate).</para>

        <para>Systematic uncertainties tend to shift all measurements in a
        systematic way so their mean value is displaced. "Systematic" means
        that when the measurement of a quantity is repeated several times, the
        uncertainty has the same size and algebraic sign for every
        measurement.</para>

        <para>Systematic uncertainties may be due to such things as incorrect
        calibration of an instrument, consistently improper use of equipment
        or failure to properly account for some effect. A systematic
        uncertainty is a true error and large systematic errors can and must
        be eliminated in a good experiment. Every effort should be made to
        minimize the possibility of these errors, by careful calibration of
        the apparatus and by use of the best possible measurement techniques.
        However, small systematic errors will always be present. For instance,
        no instrument can ever be calibrated perfectly.</para>

        <para>Other sources of systematic errors are external effects which
        can change the results of the experiment, but for which the
        corrections are not well known.</para>

        <para>Systematic errors can be more serious than random uncertainties
        for three reasons as follows:</para>

        <orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>There is no sure method for discovering and identifying them
            just by looking at the experimental data.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Their effects cannot be reduced by averaging repeated
            measurements.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>A systematic error has the same size and sign for each
            measurement in a set of repeated measurements, so there is no
            opportunity for positive and negative errors to offset each
            other.</para>
          </listitem>
        </orderedlist>

        <para>Random uncertainties fluctuate from one measurement to the next
        and are present in all experimental measurements. As such, they cause
        a measuring process to give different values when a measurement is
        repeated many times (assuming all other conditions are held constant
        to the best of the operator’s ability). Random uncertainties can have
        many causes, including operator errors or biases, fluctuating physical
        conditions, varying environmental conditions and inherent variability
        of measuring instruments.</para>

        <para>The effect that random uncertainties have on results can be
        somewhat reduced by taking repeated measurements then calculating
        their average. The average is generally considered to be a "better"
        representation of the "true value" than any single measurement,
        because uncertainties of positive and negative sign tend to compensate
        each other in the averaging process. They yield results distributed
        about some mean value.</para>

        <para>A measurement with relatively small random uncertainty is said
        to have high precision. A measurement with small random uncertainty
        and small systematic error is said to have high accuracy. Precision
        does not necessarily imply accuracy. A precise measurement may be
        inaccurate if it has a systematic error.</para>

        Measured Head</title>

        <para>Frequently, the assessed flow rate will not be measured
        directly. Rather, it will be determined through a functional
        relationship from a measurement of head with its own uncertainty. The
        question is: What is the resulting uncertainty in the assessed flow
        rate?</para>

        <para>The answer depends on the equation linking the flow rate with
        the directly measured parameters. We first return to the functional
        relationship derived for the rectangular sharp-crested weir:</para>

    <title>CULVERTS</title>

    <section xml:id="b6_ch3_s_j9gih">
      <title>Culvert Flow Principles</title>

      <para>The term “culvert” is normally applied in engineering practice to
      any large underground pipe especially where used in relatively short
      lengths to convey streams or flood water under an embankment. The design
      of culverts has been the subject of considerable research and
      considerable misunderstanding. Despite this, the culvert is such a
      common structure that analysis and design have become quite
      standardised. The hydraulic analysis and subsequent selection of the
      proper culvert size is aided by charts and nomographs prepared for the
      specific shape and type of culvert. These design procedures incorporate
      directly such factors as the entrance loss coefficient for a particular
      pipe shape and inlet configuration.</para>

      <para>The emphasis herein is on the basic analysis of culverts and is,
      thus, more general than direct recourse to design charts. It is
      accepted, of course, that engineers will continue to use the available
      charts and nomographs. However, the material presented herein is aimed
      at giving a better understanding of culvert flow principles and will
      make the use of standard charts and nomographs clearer and more
      reliable.</para>

      <para>Because a culvert is a closed conduit, it has a larger wetted
      perimeter than a channel. Accordingly, the average energy gradient
      through the culvert will be steeper than in the equivalent length of
      channel. In general, the only way that the steepening of the hydraulic
      gradient through the culvert can occur is by raising the water surface
      elevation at the upstream side of the embankment.</para>

      <para>However, the headwater level cannot be increased indefinitely
      without severe consequences. The consequent backwater effect may cause
      water to overflow the channel banks and cause flooding of the
      surrounding land. This may have severe social and economic
      repercussions. There are, however other less obvious consequences of an
      increase in the upstream water level such as bank stability, scour of
      the earth embankment, and erosion of downstream channel.</para>

      <para>It is apparent, then, that the culvert cross-sectional area and
      hydraulic properties are of great importance. It may be possible to
      evaluate economically the consequences of a headwater rise against the
      cost of the culvert and embankment height. Under these circumstances the
      system with the least total cost of structure and flooding should be
      selected.</para>

      <para>The factor subject to most misunderstanding in culvert design is
      that arising from the determination of the point of control – either
      inlet or outlet control. In some cases, the operating control is not
      clear and careful calculations are necessary to determine both the type
      of control and the various hydraulic characteristics.</para>

      <para>The hydraulic operation of culverts is complex and often difficult
      to predict. However, once the type of operation is established, the
      analysis may proceed according to well-defined principles. The factors
      affecting the discharge in a culvert are the following:</para>

      <orderedlist numeration="loweralpha">
        <listitem>
          <para>The geometry of the inlet;</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The combined effect of entrance, length, slope and roughness
          of the culvert barrel;</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The elevation of the outlet tailwater. The flow
          characteristics and, hence, the discharge capacity of a culvert are
          determined by the location of the control section. In general, the
          discharge is controlled either at the culvert entrance or at the
          outlet and is designated inlet control and outlet control
          respectively. Inlet control will exist as long as the ability of the
          culvert barrel to carry the flow exceeds the ability of water to
          enter the culvert through the inlet. Outlet control will exist when
          the ability of the culvert barrel to carry water away from the
          entrance is less than the flow than can enter the inlet. The
          location of the control section may shift as the relative capacities
          of the entrance and barrel sections change with increasing or
          decreasing discharge.</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Inlet control:</emphasis><emphasis
      role="bold"> </emphasis>With the inlet control operation, the discharge
      is independent of the pipe length, slope and roughness of the pipe wall.
      The discharge depends only upon the headwater elevation above the invert
      at the entrance, the inlet size, and the inlet geometry. Although a
      variation in factors affecting the culvert barrel will affect flow
      characteristics within a barrel, they will normally have no effect on
      the total discharge. The only exception occurs if the variations in
      barrel design are sufficiently severe to cause the control section to
      shift to the outlet.</para>

      <para>A culvert operating under inlet control will always flow part full
      for at lest part of the culvert length. In many cases, particularly at
      high discharges, the headwater will submerge the entrance of the
      culvert. In these cases, flow contraction occurring at the entrance will
      limit the discharge. It should be noted that roughness, slope and length
      are not influential in determining the discharge capacity of a culvert
      operating with inlet control, but are important in determining outlet
      velocities and the discharge at which the operation mode changes from
      inlet control to outlet control.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Outlet control:</emphasis> Under outlet
      control, the total discharge is affected by all hydraulic factors
      upstream of the outlet. These factors include the headwater elevation,
      entrance geometry, barrel size, wall roughness, barrel length and slope.
      The tailwater elevation is a factor as long as it is above the pipe
      outlet. Culverts flowing full throughout their length are always under
      outlet control. However, as will be shown, a culvert flowing part full
      may operate under either inlet control or outlet control.</para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Hydraulic Analysis: </emphasis>For
      computational convenience, flow through culverts is divided into size
      categories based on the relative heights of the head and tailwater and,

      <para>In many given design situations the control type (i.e inlet or
      outlet) will be obvious. Occasionally, however, this will not be the
      case. Where it is not obvious the evaluation is best made by assuming
      both cases and comparing the results. In the analysis of a given
      culvert, the resulting discharge given values of headwater and tailwater
      or the value of headwater given tailwater and discharge, would be the
      usual goals. If the discharge is determined by assuming both inlet and
      outlet control, the lower of the two values would prevail.
      Correspondingly, if the value of headwater is needed, then the higher
      would prevail. The design problem of selecting a satisfactory culvert
      size would be based on evaluating both types of control and choosing the
      larger indicated size.</para>

      <para>In this section the methods of culvert analysis for various flow
      types have been discussed. Under most field conditions, the computations

        <para>This example requires the determination of the discharge through
        a culvert where it is unclear if the culvert is flowing under inlet or
        outlet control. In this case, two discharges must be determined,
        assuming respectively inlet and outlet control. A comparison of the
        two discharges yields the prevailing control and the true
        discharge.</para>

        <para><emphasis role="bold">Problem Statement:</emphasis> The invert
        of a box culvert, 1.5 m square in section, has a uniform slope of 1:25
        in the first 150 m downstream from the culvert entrance. Over the next
        1500 m, the invert has a uniform slope of 1:2500. The culvert then
        discharges into a tailwater pool whose surface level is 3 m above the
        invert level at the downstream end of the culvert. The culvert is made
        of concrete of <inlineequation>

        <para>There are several practical factors associated with culvert
        design which may be of equal importance as the hydraulic analysis.
        Some of these aspects are discussed in the following.</para>

        <section xml:id="b6_c3_s_7kmp2">
          <title>Inlet Design</title>

          <para>Full utilisation of the culvert cross sectional area requires
          that it should run full or nearly so. This may not be possible
          especially in the case of low tailwater levels or steep gradients,
          leading to flow Type 5. Careful attention is then necessary in the
          inlet design to ensure minimum contraction of the flow and, hence, a
          maximum discharge coefficient. The objective is to ensure that the
          flow traverses the inlet section with a minimum of
          separation.</para>

          <para>A variety of methods are available for improving the inlet
          conditions and these include a steep throat, a drop inlet,
          wingwalls, a hood and bevelled edges. The shape of the soffit is the
          most important and of the invert, the least important, because the
          flow at the invert is horizontal.</para>

          <para>Some of these inlet improvements are illustrated schematically
          in<emphasis role="bold"> </emphasis><xref
          linkend="b6_ch3_f_b8szr"/><emphasis role="bold">.</emphasis> The
          simplest improvement is a vertical headwall above the culvert
          entrance, thereby eliminating the re-entrant angle in the case of a
          battered embankment. The soffit of the inlet can be bevelled as
          shown in <xref linkend="b6_ch3_f_b8szr"/><emphasis
          role="bold">(a)</emphasis>. It is recommended that the bevel be at
          least 10% of the culvert height and at between 33° and 45° to the
          culvert axis (Portland Cement Association 1964)<emphasis
          role="bold">.</emphasis> This can increase the flow by up to
          20%.</para>

          <para>Full details and design charts and tables for improved
          culverts inlets may be found in a number of publications [e.g US
          Department of Transportation (1972) and Portland Cement Association
          (1964)].</para>

        <section xml:id="b6_c3_s_tnqgj">
          <title>Outlet Design</title>

          <para>In practice, culvert outlets have little significance in
          efficient culvert operation. However, outlet structures have two
          important practical purposes:</para>

          <orderedlist>
            <listitem>
              <para>to retain the embankment and support the end of the
              culvert;</para>
            </listitem>

            <listitem>
              <para>to prevent damage by scour to the culvert, embankment,
              stream bed, or adjacent property.</para>
            </listitem>
          </orderedlist>

          <para>Despite the common practice of making inlet and outlet
          structures identical, it should be noted that the two structures
          serve different purposes and, therefore, logically should be treated
          separately.</para>

          <para>A number of different types of culvert outlets are shown in
          <xref linkend="b6_ch3_f_af56r"/>.</para>

          <para>The simple projecting outlet is sufficient when flow
          velocities are low and the fill does not require special protection.
          The endwall structure alone acts to support the end of the culvert
          and as a retaining wall for the embankment. The wingwall helps to
          transition the culvert flow smoothly into the downstream channel and
          protects the endwall so that it may continue to function in its
          original capacity. A concrete apron serves to provide protection to
          the endwall structure by removing the point of potential erosion
          well away from the endwall foundation, thereby ensuring the
          stability of the structure.</para>

          <para>Where wingwalls are used for bank protection and not merely as
          retaining walls, a concrete apron should always be provided. The
          absence of such an apron may encourage channelling and undercutting
          along the wingwall.</para>

          <para>Where outlet velocities are particularly high, special energy
          dissipation structures may be required.</para>

          <para>Scour at culvert outlets is not necessarily only due to
          concentrated flow issuing from the culvert barrel. Recirculating
          eddies, associated with a downstream channel which is significantly
          wider than the culvert, can cause potentially serious scour damage
          to the embankment fill. A further form of scour at culvert outlets
          is channel degradation which may occur if the culvert does not
          permit the passage of sediment from upstream.</para>

          <para>Whatever the cause, the process of erosion may be associated
          with the excavated material being redeposited in the channel some
          distance downstream from the point of scour. It is entirely possible
          that, with time, a shoal will form capable of causing excessively
          high tailwater depths during periods of high flow. Such a process
          should always be considered because high tailwater depths may not
          necessarily work to the advantage of culvert operation.</para>

          <para>Erosive velocities vary widely, depending upon the
          characteristics of the channel material, the depth of flow in the
          channel, and the velocity distribution. Erosive velocity limits for
          various types of soils are published in a number of texts [e.g.
          Portland Cement Association (1964)]. Such published values should,
          however, be treated with caution because of the vast variations in
          naturally occurring materials.</para>

          <para>Special problems occur in situations where relief culverts
          discharge directly on to an unchannelled flood plain. In this case,
          the tailwater level is likely to be significantly lower that the
          water level of the emerging supercritical jet. The erosive potential
          in this case is high and a schematic of the flow situation is shown
          in <xref linkend="b6_ch3_f_ytr1j"/>.</para>

          <para>It is apparent that the discharging jet will spread beyond the
          culvert and energy dissipation additional to bed friction will
          result from the interaction between the jet and the tailwater. The
          latter phenomenon is manifested in the zones of recirculation shown
          in<emphasis role="bold"> </emphasis><xref

          <para>One method of analysis for this case has been proposed by
          Keller (1986). He drew a comparison between this phenomenon and that
          due to the interaction between shallow flood plain and deep main
          channel flows where the turbulent shear stresses are of the same
          order of magnitude as an equivalent wall shear stress if the
          interaction region were replaced by a solid wall. The present case
          can then be solved by assuming that the culvert outflow is contained
          within diverging vertical walls of roughness equal to that of the
          bed. A divergence angle of about 20° is indicated by the work of
          Rouse et al. (1951) and List and Imberger (1973). The modification
          of the outlet velocity with distance from the outlet can then be
          calculated using a water surface profile program such as HEC-RAS and
          appropriate invert protection determined.</para>

      <title>Introduction</title>

      <para>Bridges are a necessary component of waterways that are crossed by
      roads and other embankment structures. For reasons of economy, bridges
      do not span the full width of a river, especially when it is in flood.
      The flow through bridges inevitably, then, involves energy losses that
      reflect in a higher water surface elevation upstream than would be the
      case if the waterway could flow freely.</para>

      <para>Despite the simple appearance of a bridge, its hydraulics is by no
      means simple. In addition to the potential for the constricted flow
      through a bridge site to cause flooding, there is a second issue of
      importance in the assessment of bridges and this is the issue of scour.
      Bridges continue to fail through scour of piers and/or abutments and it
      is vital to be able to determine the magnitude of this scour. Both the
      energy loss at a bridge site and the potential for scour are complex
      topics and special techniques have been developed to cope with their
      difficulties.</para>

      <para>It should be noted that conservatism in the design of bridge
      waterways for their flooding potential requires an under-estimate of the
      magnitude of scour since this will minimise the size of the bridge
      opening, maximise the velocity through the bridge, and maximise the
      energy loss across the bridge. Conversely, conservatism in assessing the
      structural integrity of the bridge requires an over-estimate of the
      magnitude of scour. Thus, it is important to keep in mind the reason for
      undertaking the hydraulic analysis of the bridge site when assessing the
      results of such an analysis.</para>

      <para>In this chapter, the hydraulics of flow through bridges is
      discussed, with special emphasis on energy losses and scour. A brief
      discussion is also presented on the bridge analysis routines contained
      within the HEC-RAS computer program.</para>

      <title>Energy Losses at Bridges</title>

      <para>Energy losses at bridge sites have three components. The first
      consists of losses that occur in the reach immediately downstream from
      the structure where an expansion of flow takes place. The second
      component comprises the losses that occur at the structure itself. The
      third component comprises the losses that occur in the reach immediately
      upstream of the structure where the flow is contracting to pass through
      the bridge opening. These three components are illustrated in <xref
      linkend="b6_ch3_f_j0ucv"/>.</para>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>

        <para>Bridge losses within the expansion reach downstream (sections 1
        to 2) can be relatively large. The region is characterised by
        recirculation zones on either side that are maintained by extracting
        energy from the mean flow. Energy losses through the contraction
        (sections 3 to 4) are relatively smaller because the channel length
        over which the change in cross-section occurs is less and the
        recirculation zones are smaller.</para>

        <para>Within each of these regions the energy loss is normally
        calculated as the sum of friction losses and expansion or contraction
        losses. Friction and contraction losses between sections 3 and 4 are
        calculated the same as friction and expansion losses between sections
        1 and 2. Friction losses are typically determined using standard step
        profile equations. Contraction and Expansion losses are described in
        terms of a coefficient times the absolute value of the change in
        velocity head between adjacent cross sections. For a detailed
        discussion on selecting contraction and expansion coefficients at
        bridges, the user is referred to chapter 5 of the HEC-RAS Hydraulic
        Reference Manual (US Army Corps of Engineers 2001).</para>

        <para>Within the bridge structure itself (between sections 2 and 3)
        the computation of the energy loss can be simple or complex, depending
        on the flow characteristics. A low flow, where the water surface does
        not interact with the bottom chord of the bridge, may be analysed
        using a simple standard step procedure. On the other hand, interaction
        of the water surface with the bridge deck structure may lead to a
        combination of low flow and weir flow or pressure flow and weir flow.
        These cases require more complex modelling techniques that are outside
        the scope of this section. Modelling details may be found in the
        HEC-RAS Hydraulic Reference Manual (US Army Corps of Engineers
        2001).</para>

        <para>In most cases of flow through bridge sites, the river flow
        downstream and upstream is sub-critical. Under these circumstances,
        the hydraulic effect of the bridge is to increase the water level
        upstream of the bridge, with no effect downstream. On the other hand,
        in the rare cases where the natural flow is characterised by
        super-critical conditions, the effect of the bridge manifests
        downstream. In such cases, upstream water levels are affected only if
        the bridge constriction is sufficiently severe to transform the
        supercritical flow to subcritical.</para>

        <para>It is noted that the bridge routines in HEC-RAS allow the
        modeller to analyse a bridge with several different methods without
        changing the bridge geometry. The bridge routines have the ability to
        model low flow, low flow and weir flow (with adjustments for
        submergence), pressure flow (orifice and sluice gate equations),
        pressure and weir flow, and high flows with the energy equation only.
        HEC-RAS modelling also allows for multiple bridge openings at a single
        location.</para>

      <para>Non-standard bridge crossings include perched bridges, submerged
      bridges, skewed bridges, parallel bridges and multiple opening bridges.
      Notes on the modelling of each are presented in the following. A perched
      bridge is one for which the road approaching the bridge is at the flood
      plain ground level, and only in the immediate area of the bridge does
      the road rise above ground level to span the water course. This

      <para>A typical flow situation with this type of bridge is low flow
      under the bridge and overbank flow around the bridge. Because the road
      approaching the bridge is usually not much higher than the surrounding
      ground, the assumption of weir flow is usually not justified.</para>

      <para>For this reason, perched bridges should generally be modelled
      using the energy-based method, especially when a large percentage of the
      total flow rate is carried in the overbank areas.</para>

      <para>A submerged bridge (or low water bridge) is designed to
      accommodate only low flows under the bridge. Flood flows are carried
      over the bridge and road. A typical example of a submerged bridge is
      shown in <xref linkend="b6_ch3_f_vnhzo"/>.</para>

      <para>When modelling this bridge for flood flows, the anticipated

      most of the flow passing over the top of the bridge, the correction for
      submergence can introduce considerable error. For this reason, if the

      <para>A skewed bridge crossing is generally handled by making
      adjustments to the bridge dimensions to define an equivalent
      cross-section perpendicular to the flow lines. For low flow, skewed
      crossings with angles up to 20 degrees show no objectionable flow
      patterns. However, for larger angles of skew, the flow efficiency
      decreases. For reasonably small flow contractions, the projected length
      is adequate for assessing the impact of skew up to skew angles of 30
      degrees.</para>

      <para>Scour can be defined simply as the excavation and removal of

      action of flowing water. In the context of this book, it is assumed that
      this erosive action may potentially expose the foundations of a bridge.
      Scour is usually considered to be a local phenomenon, but includes
      degradation that can cause erosion over a considerable length of a

        <para>The biggest and most frequently encountered scour-related
        problems usually concern loose sediments that are easily eroded. It is
        not true, however, to assume that the scour depth in cohesive or
        cemented soils can not be as large – it merely takes longer for the
        scour hole to develop.</para>

        <para>Many of the equations for scour were derived from laboratory
        studies, for which the range of validity is unknown. Some were
        verified using very limited field data, which itself may be of
        doubtful accuracy. In the field, the scour hole that develops on the
        rising stage of a flood, or at the peak, may be filled in again on the
        falling stage. For this reason, the maximum depth of scour cannot be
        easily assessed after the event.</para>

        <para>Scour can also cause problems with the hydraulic analysis of a
        bridge. Scour may considerably deepen the channel through a bridge and
        effectively reduce or even eliminate the backwater. This reduction in
        backwater should not be relied on, however, because of the
        unpredictable nature of the processes involved.</para>

        <para>When considering scour it is normal to distinguish between
        non-cohesive or cohesionless (alluvial) sediments and cohesive
        material. The former are usually of most interest and are considered
        further in this section. Cohesive materials require special techniques
        and are outside the scope of this chapter.</para>

        <para>The first major issue when considering scour is the distinction
        between clear-water scour and<emphasis role="bold">
        </emphasis>live-bed scour. The critical issue here is whether or not
        the mean bed shear stress of the flow upstream of the bridge is less
        than or larger than the threshold value needed to move the bed
        material.</para>

        <para>If the upstream shear stress is less than the threshold value,
        the bed material upstream of the bridge is at rest. This is referred
        to as the clear-water condition because the approach flow is clear and
        does not contain sediment. Thus, any bed material that is removed from
        a local scour hole is not replaced by sediment being transported by
        the approach flow. The maximum local scour depth is achieved when the
        size of the scour hole results in a local reduction in shear stress to
        the critical value such that the flow can no longer remove bed
        material from the scoured area.</para>

        <para>Live-bed scour occurs where the upstream shear stress is greater
        than the threshold value and the bed material upstream of the crossing
        is moving. This means that the approach flow continuously transports
        sediment into a local scour hole. By itself, a live bed in a uniform
        channel will not cause a scour hole - for this to be created some
        additional increase in shear stress is needed, such as that caused by
        a contraction (natural or artificial, such as a bridge) or a local
        obstruction (e.g. a bridge pier). The equilibrium scour depth is
        achieved when material is transported into the scour hole at the same
        rate at which it is transported out.</para>

        <para>These concepts are illustrated by <xref

            <para>Flow over grassed floodplains.</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

        <para>At any particular location both clear-water and live-bed scour
        may be experienced. During a single flood the bed shear stress will
        increase and decrease as the discharge rises and falls. Thus, it is
        possible to have clear-water conditions initially, then a live bed,
        then finally clear water again. The maximum scour depth may occur
        under clear-water conditions, not at the flood peak when live-bed
        scour is experienced. Similarly, relatively high velocities can be
        experienced when the flow is just contained within the banks, rather
        than spread over the floodplains at the peak discharge.</para>

        <para>It is also possible to have the clear-water and live-bed
        conditions occurring at the same time. For example, if the floodplains
        are grassed or composed of material that is larger in diameter than
        that in the main channel, clear-water conditions may occur on the
        floodplain with live-bed conditions in the main channel.</para>

        <para>It is evident from this discussion that the problem may not
        always be as simple or as well defined as would be desirable. If there
        are any uncertainties or if the consequences of failure are large,
        prompting a conservative approach, it is recommended that clear-water
        conditions be assumed at the peak flow condition.</para>

        <para>Urbanisation has the effect of increasing flood magnitudes and
        causing hydrographs to peak earlier, resulting in higher stream
        velocities and degradation. Channel improvements or the extraction of
        gravel (above or below the site in question) can alter water levels,
        flow velocities, bed slopes and sediment transport characteristics and
        consequently affect scour. For instance, if an alluvial channel is
        straightened, widened or altered in any other way that results in an
        increased flow-energy condition, the channel will tend back towards a
        lower energy state by degrading upstream, widening and aggrading
        downstream.</para>

        <para>The significance of degradation scour to bridge design is that
        the engineer has to decide whether the existing channel elevation is
        likely to be constant over the 100 year life of the bridge, or whether
        it will change. If change is probable then it must be allowed for when
        designing the waterway and foundations.</para>

        <para>The lateral stability of a river channel may also affect scour
        depths, because movement of the channel may result in the bridge being
        incorrectly positioned or aligned with respect to the approach flow.
        This problem can be significant under any circumstances but is
        potentially very serious in arid or semi-arid regions and with
        ephemeral (intermittent) streams. Lateral migration rates are largely
        unpredictable. Sometimes a channel that has been stable for many years
        may suddenly start to move, but significant influences are floods,
        bank material, vegetation of the banks and floodplains, and land
        use.</para>

        <para>Scour at bridge sites is typically classified as contraction (or
        constriction) scour and local scour. Contraction scour occurs over a
        whole cross-section as a result of the increased velocities and bed
        shear stresses arising from a narrowing of the channel by a
        constriction such as a bridge. In general, the smaller the opening
        ratio (<inlineequation>

          </inlineequation>) the larger the waterway velocity and the greater
        the potential for scour. If the flow contracts from a wide floodplain,
        considerable scour and bank failure can occur. Relatively severe
        constrictions may require regular maintenance for decades to combat
        erosion. It is evident that one way to reduce contraction scour is to
        make the opening wider.</para>

        <para>Local scour arises from the increased velocities and associated
        vortices as water accelerates around the corners of abutments, piers
        and spur dykes. The flow pattern around a cylindrical pier is shown in
        <xref linkend="b6_ch3_f_4m134"/>. The approaching flow decelerates as
        it nears the cylinder, coming to rest at the centre of the pier. The
        resulting stagnation pressure is highest near the water surface where
        the approach velocity is greatest, and smaller lower down. The
        downward pressure gradient at the pier face directs the flow
        downwards. Local pier scour begins when the downflow velocity near the
        stagnation point is strong enough to overcome the resistance to motion
        of the bed particles.</para>

        <para>Without a scour hole the maximum downward velocity is about 40%
        of the mean approach velocity, the maximum strength of the downflow
        being recorded just below bed level. When scour occurs the maximum
        downflow velocity is about 80% of the mean approach velocity. The
        impact of the downflow on the bed is the principal factor leading to
        the creation of a scour hole. As the hole grows the flow dives down
        and around the pier producing a horseshoe vortex, which carries the
        scoured bed material downstream.</para>

        <para>The combination of the downflow with the horseshoe vortex is the
        dominant scour mechanism. As the scour hole becomes progressively
        deeper the downflow near the bottom of the scour hole decreases until
        at some point in time equilibrium is reached and the depth remains
        constant.</para>

        <para>At the sides of the pier flow separation occurs, resulting in a
        wake vortex whose whirlpool action sucks up sediment from the bed. As
        the vortices diminish and velocities reduce, the scoured material is
        deposited some distance downstream of the pier.</para>

        <para>For piers that are essentially rectangular in plan and aligned
        to the flow the basic scour mechanism is similar to that just
        described, although rather more severe because of the square corners.
        However, as the angle of attack to a rectangular pier increases, so
        does its effective width, so the scour depth increases and the point
        of maximum scour moves downstream of the nose to a point on the
        exposed side.</para>

        <para>With a large degree of skew the maximum scour may occur at the
        downstream end of the pier. If the flow direction is likely to change
        there is merit in using cylindrical piers to avoid these
        complications.</para>

        <para>The scour mechanism at a bridge abutment is similar to that at a
        pier, although the boundary layer at the abutment or channel wall may
        result in an additional deceleration of the flow compared with a
        central pier. The approach flow can be considered as separating into
        an upper layer, which forms an upflow surface roller on hitting the
        abutment, and a lower layer, which becomes the bottom or principal
        vortex. This is shown schematically in <xref
        linkend="b6_ch3_f_dexpb"/>.</para>

        <para>Viewed in plan, the upper layer divides or separates, with part
        of the flow accelerating around the upstream corner of the abutment
        into the bridge waterway while the remainder slowly rotates in an
        almost stationary pool trapped against the face of the abutment and
        the river bank.</para>

        <para>In the bottom layer, the flow near the bank forms an almost
        vertical downflow, while that nearer to the end of the abutment
        accelerates down and into the waterway, forming the principal vortex.
        Usually scouring starts in this region of accelerating flow and grows
        along the faces of the abutment. Wake vortices form downstream of the
        abutment.</para>

        <para>The basic scouring process is the same for most types of
        abutment, although with wingwall and vertical wall types the
        stagnation region is larger, and scour is most severe near the end of
        the abutment where the principal vortex is concentrated.</para>

        <para>The total scour depth is obtained by summing degradation,
        contraction and local scour. This procedure is, strictly, only valid
        where the scour holes overlap. For instance, contraction scour may
        have to be added to pier or abutment scour to get the total scour
        depth. However, pier scour and abutment scour would not be added
        unless the two scour holes overlap.</para>

        <para>This usually has to be determined by drawing a cross-section
        through the waterway and superimposing the scour depths. If the holes
        do overlap the resultant scour depth is often larger than the two
        components, but difficult to predict. Nevertheless, as a general and
        conservative rule, the total scour depth is the sum of the three
        components.</para>

        <para>The scour computation capability in the HEC-RAS software allows
        the user to compute contraction scour and local scour at piers and
        abutments. The details may be found in the HEC-RAS Hydraulic Reference

    <title>ROCK CHUTES FOR BED PROTECTION</title>

    <section xml:id="b6_ch3_s_0atr7">
      <title>Introduction</title>

      <para>The stability of rivers and channels is often linked to the
      stability of the channel bed. Channels may be de-stabilised by (for
      example) the draining of a downstream swamp, which can initiate an
      erosion head that, unchecked, will migrate upstream with substantial
      subsequent bank collapse.</para>

      <para>A rock chute is a relatively short and steep section of the bed of
      a channel which has been armoured with rock. It is normally intended to
      either stabilize an erosion head, preventing it from moving upstream in
      the channel, or to reduce the overall grade of a channel by providing a
      weir within the channel bed.</para>

      <para>Although the concept of a rock chute is simple, proper hydraulic
      design is very important to ensure that the chute geometry and rock size
      are matched with the expected flow conditions such that the rock remains
      stable under all expected flow conditions. In addition, appropriate rock
      chute design requires that the abutments are treated to prevent failure
      by outflanking of the crest and that the grading of rock sizes within
      the rock mixture minimizes the presence of voids.</para>

      <para>This section summarises the theory for the proper hydraulic design
      of rock chutes and introduces a spreadsheet-based computer program,
      CHUTE, to design and analyse the performance of a chute under a range of
      flow conditions. This program has been developed as part of the CRC for
      Catchment Hydrology toolkit program. (http://www.toolkit.net.au/)</para>

      <para>In the following section, the essential elements for the hydraulic
      design of a rock chute are discussed. The design theory is then

      <para>A typical rock chute is shown schematically in <xref
      linkend="b6_ch3_f_a84wk"/>, together with an illustration of the various
      terms used in describing and designing a rock chute. From a hydraulic
      point of view, the primary elements are the chute face and the apron,
      since these provide protection to the bed from the erosive forces of the
      water.</para>

      <para>The primary design output is the rock size required to ensure a
      stable structure. Because the rock size is dependent on the bed shear
      stress, which, in turn, is dependent on the flow profile over the chute,
      a key element in the design process is the determination of the water
      surface profile</para>

      </emphasis>shows, schematically, the three types of profile that may
      occur.</para>

      <para>It will be shown in the following section that the location of the
      point of maximum bed shear stress coincides with the location of the
      minimum depth. Clearly this location is dependent on the type of profile
      over the chute.</para>

      <para>The profile shown in <xref linkend="b6_ch3_f_op7dn"/>(c) is most
      likely to be associated with the maximum design flow in the river. With
      lower controlling tail water levels, the profiles shown in <xref
      linkend="b6_ch3_f_op7dn"/>(a) and <xref linkend="b6_ch3_f_op7dn"/>(b)
      are associated with flow rates less than the maximum. Because of the
      lower minimum depths associated with the latter profiles, it is likely
      that the bed shear stresses will be larger with a consequent increase in
      the rock size required for stability.</para>

      <para>This discussion demonstrates that the chute design flow rate –
      that for which the required rock size is a maximum – will be lower than
      the channel design flow rate - that for which the required channel
      capacity is a maximum. This is a most important distinction in the
      design of a rock chute and receives further comment later in this
      section.</para>

      Reynolds Number is above a certain value, typically taken to be about
      400. This corresponds to a particle size of about 6mm (Henderson 1966).
      In all practical chute designs, the rock size will always be larger than
      this value, so the use of the equation is justified.</para>

      <para>The magnitude of the constant is the subject of some difference of
      opinion in the literature. The classic work of Shields (Henderson 1966)
      produced a value of 0.056, although other studies have yielded lower
      values. For the present study, a more conservative value of 0.047 is
      chosen, consistent with the work of (Meyer-Peter and Muller 1948) and
      (Yalin and Karahan 1979).</para>

      <para>A chute may have bed slopes up to 20%, so the flat-bed assumption
      in the development of the equation is non-conservative. This further

        <para>For the case shown in <xref linkend="b6_ch3_f_yfk9w"/>, two
        depths control the combined flow profile – critical depth at the chute
        crest and a known downstream subcritical depth. The downstream depth
        is dependent on controls further downstream and would normally be
        established from a one-dimensional program such as HEC-RAS (US Army
        Corps of Engineers 2002).</para>

        <para>The S2 profile downstream of the chute crest and the A1 or M1
        profile over and upstream of the chute apron are computed using the
        standard step method, described in (eg) (Henderson 1966). The location
        of the hydraulic jump is then determined as the point where the
        upstream and downstream depths form a conjugate pair – ie the Momentum
        Function is the same.</para>

        <para>For the case shown in <xref linkend="b6_ch3_f_op7dn"/>(c), the
        subcritical profile, controlled by the downstream depth, is everywhere
        higher than the conjugate profile, computed from the assumed upstream
        supercritical profile. In this case, the chute is said to be
        drowned.</para>

        <para>Although the computational details are standard, it needs to be
        recognised that the computed profiles are dependent on Manning’s
        roughness coefficient, which, in turn, is linked to the unknown rock
        size through the Strickler Equation (Henderson 1966):</para>

      <para>One important design input parameter is the factor of safety.
      Issues which govern the choice of value include the consequences of
      failure, the reliability of the input parameters, the quality and
      consistency of the available rock, and the likelihood of eventual
      stabilisation by vegetation.</para>

      <para>As a guide, values above 1.3 are appropriate where there are grave
      consequences of failure to property or assets. Values between 1.0 and
      1.3 are applicable where the objective is general erosion control, where
      the risk of catastrophic failure is small, and where vegetation will
      eventually enhance the stability of the chute.</para>

      <para>There are a number of other important details in the design of
      rock chutes. These include the specification of rock quality, grading,
      and thickness; details of filters and cutoff walls; and the treatment of
      abutments to prevent outflanking.</para>

      <para>Rock quality, grading, and thickness issues; and the design of
      filters, are the same as those for riprap design (Hemphill and Bramley
      1989). Cutoff walls are essential to minimise the risk of piping
      failures beneath the chute or through the abutments. Their importance
      increases with the permeability of the parent material, decreasing
      cohesion of the parent material, and the height and steepness of the
      chute. Abutments must be keyed into the banks of the channel. Rock
      riprap protection should be placed upstream and downstream of the chute
      to provide direct abutment protection.</para>

    <title>ROCK RIPRAP</title>

    <section xml:id="b6_ch3_s_boaff">
      <title>Introduction</title>

      <para>Rip-rap is the term given to loose rock armour, usually obtained
      by quarrying. It is widely used for bank protection. Useful engineering
      qualities of rip-rap include:</para>

      <orderedlist>

          currents</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>Durability</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>

      <para>Rip-rap is normally placed by machine in the dry, although it can
      be tidied or even placed by hand, to improve its packing density or to
      key larger stones into the underlayer or subsoil. As with granular
      underlayers, rip-rap can become segregated into different sized zones if
      dumped into place. The aim of machine placing is always to release the
      material as close as possible to its final position. Later spreading, by
      bulldozer or otherwise, may increase breakage, segregation, and surface
      roughness.</para>

      <para>A major advantage of rip-rap protection is that it is very
      flexible. As a result, damage tends to occur gradually and, as stones
      move relative to each other, is, to some extent, self-healing. This
      allows maintenance work to be undertaken on a routine basis – in
      contrast to rigid protection systems, such as concrete blocks, which
      require immediate repairs to prevent widespread progressive failure once
      localised failure occurs. It is, nevertheless, important that
      maintenance is carried out, since the misaligned surface where stones
      have been lost or where deformation has occurred will generally
      experience higher than average hydrodynamic forces.</para>

      <para>Although the concept of rock rip-rap is simple, proper hydraulic
      design is very important to ensure that the river geometry and rock size
      are matched with the expected flow conditions such that the rock remains
      stable under all expected flow conditions. In addition, appropriate
      rip-rap design requires that a number of other issues are adequately
      addressed. In particular:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>The grading of sizes within the rock rip-rap minimises the
          presence of voids within the protective layer and minimises the area
          of individual rocks exposed to forces from the flow.</para>

          <para>A filter layer is provided where necessary to prevent bank

        <para>The design procedure is essentially a development and
        simplification of the group of methods based on tractive force
        analysis, and particularly the so-called Factor of Safety method
        developed by Simons and co-workers and documented by (Simons and
        Senturk, 1977).</para>

        <para>The theory is based on a fundamental force balance, requiring
        that, at the point of incipient particle motion, the disturbing forces
        on the particle (drag force exerted by the flow and weight component
        resolved down the slope) are balanced by the restoring forces (the
        product of the weight component resolved perpendicular to the bank and
        the tan of the natural angle of repose of the rip-rap
        material).</para>

        <para>Utilising a number of verified assumptions the force balance can
        be expressed in terms of:</para>

        <para>Each of these is considered in the following.</para>
      </figure>

      <section xml:id="b6_ch3_s_ngne8">
        <title>Extent of bank protection</title>

        <para>There are no universal rules to determine the extent of bank
        protection appropriate to a particular site and design case. Factors
        to be considered include the cost of protection, acceptable degree of
        risk, and consequences of failure. The following paragraphs provide
        some guidance in this assessment.</para>
      </section>

      <section xml:id="b6_ch3_s_dxe6r">
        <title>Length of bank to be protected</title>

        <para>A site inspection and an understanding of the mechanisms causing
        erosion will assist in determining the appropriate length of bank to
        be treated. Aerial photographs will provide guidance in understanding
        the temporal development of the river alignment and, together with
        local knowledge, will often assist in determining the history of
        erosion at the site. Such a history is often a valuable indicator of
        likely future developments.</para>

        <para>Flow lines and corresponding points of attack will vary
        significantly with the flow level. In a meandering stream, the main
        current lines tend to straighten, and the point of attack on a bend
        will tend to move downstream, with increasing flow. Braided streams
        are less predictable.</para>

        <para>Erosion on the outside of bends will also move downstream with
        time. For this reason, it is desirable to continue erosion protection
        downstream beyond the limit of existing erosion. Generous location of
        the downstream limit is essential to successful rip-rap protection. As
        a guide for the treatment of major meander developments, rip-rap
        protection should be provided for a distance of twice the bank-to-bank
        distance downstream of the existing erosion.</para>

        <para>The upstream limit of erosion protection is generally easier to
        locate. As a guide for the treatment of major meander developments,
        rip-rap protection should be provided for a distance upstream of the
        existing erosion equal to the bank-to-bank distance.</para>
      </section>

      <section xml:id="b6_ch3_s_uchbv">
        <title>Proportion of bank height to be protected</title>

        <para>It is generally not necessary to extend rip-rap protection to
        the top of the bank unless dictated by unusual site constraints. Such
        constraints may include the presence of strong overbank flows, upper
        bank erosion by strong wave action or prolonged high flows, and severe
        consequences of rip-rap failure.</para>

        <para>As a general rule, protection of the lower two thirds of a bank
        is usually considered to offer optimum protection. The upper one third
        of the bank can be treated, as appropriate, with less resistant and
        less expensive techniques such as vegetation.</para>

        <para>However, this rule should always be reviewed in the light of
        local knowledge and conditions. For example, conditions where a river
        has a very high bank such that bank-full flows are reached less than
        once a year, may justify a reduction in the height of protection.
        Conversely, a low bank, relative to the level of the annual flood, may
        need full protection.</para>

        <para>An understanding of the mode of failure also assists in this
        assessment. For example, if the bank failure mechanism is through
        undermining of the toe and subsequent collapse, protection of the toe
        is crucial. On the other hand, if fretting at high levels is primarily
        responsible for erosion, it is more important to provide protection at
        that water level.</para>

        <para>In designing extensive rip-rap works, it may be desirable to
        consider, in addition, the stream longitudinal profile. This gives the
        designer the additional options of ensuring that the height of rip-rap
        protection represents an adequate proportion of the average bank
        height, or allowing the rip-rap height to vary along the reach to
        reflect variations in the water surface profile.</para>
      </section>

      <section xml:id="b6_ch3_s_r2lvb">
        <title>Allowance for scour at toe of rip-rap</title>

        <para>Many failures of rip-rap occur through undermining of the toe of
        the rip-rap by scour of the stream bed during high flow events. Two
        methods of allowing for this, illustrated in <xref
        linkend="b6_ch3_f_me94m"/>, are:</para>

        <orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>Extend the rip-rap protection below the estimated scour
            level by placing rip-rap material in an excavated trench.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Provide extra rip-rap material at the toe of the bank which
            can drop down and provide protection should scour occur.</para>
          </listitem>
        </orderedlist>

        <para>Use of the second alternative requires care. The response of the
        rip-rap to settling is unpredictable. In particular, if a graded rock
        is used – as is recommended – the finer material will be susceptible
        to loss during settlement. Accordingly, it is recommended that
        allowance should be made for at least 50% loss of rock.</para>

        <para>In a particular design situation, the likely severity of bed
        scour needs to be assessed. Although this assessment should be
        technically based on techniques for estimating scour depth, the
        particular design situation is also of great importance. The following

            <para>In meandering gravel bed rivers, allowance for scour on the

        <title>Specification for rock quality and grading and thickness of
        layer</title>

        <para>Rock should be hard, tough, and durable. It should have a
        crushing strength of at least 25MPa. The rock should be free of
        defined cleavage planes and should not be adversely affected by
        repeated wetting and drying.</para>

        <para>The rock should be predominantly angular in shape with not more
        than 25% of rocks, distributed through the gradation, having a length
        more than twice the breadth or thickness. No rock should have a length
        exceeding 2.5 times its breadth or thickness.</para>

        <para>Where rock fails to meet this specification, it may still be
        considered at the designers discretion, provided allowance is made in
        the design for its shortcomings.</para>

        <para>Rock to meet the necessary size and strength criteria will
        normally be won from a hard rock quarry by drilling and blasting. A
        hydraulic rock breaker mounted on a hydraulic excavator provides an
        excellent means of producing rock to design size
        specifications.</para>

        <para>Rock should not be single sized, but, instead, should be a
        well-graded mixture designed to ensure that all interstices between
        large rocks are filled with rock of progressively smaller size. This
        has the effect of ensuring that no significant voids occur in the rock
        blanket through which underlying material can be washed out.
        Additionally, it helps to create an interlocking mass of rock which is
        highly stable.</para>

        <para>The thickness of rock rip-rap protection should be at least
        twice the median rip-rap diameter or equal to the largest rocks in the
        rip-rap mixture, whichever is the greater.</para>

        <title>Details of filters</title>

        <para>Filter materials may be necessary to stabilise rip-rap
        protection over fine material. The filter layer prevents bed material
        being washed through residual interstices in the rock layer. Normally,
        a filter layer is only necessary where the underlying material is
        largely non-cohesive such as uniform sand or silt, high groundwater
        levels create large pore pressures, or an unusually high factor of
        safety is required. If one or more of these conditions prevails, the
        need for a filter layer can be further assessed from the following

        <para>If the relationship between bed material grading and chute rock

        <para>A granular filter layer can be designed by applying the above

        <para>In those conditions which require provision of a filter layer
        between the rip-rap and the parent material, geotextile can be an
        alternative to a filter layer.</para>

        <para>However, caution is recommended. Several failures and partial
        failures have occurred involving rock sliding on the filter cloth.
        This occurs where the friction between the rock and the filter cloth
        is less than the internal friction of the rock mix.</para>

        <para>The most vulnerable design cases are those for which the
        hydraulic forces are relatively small, permitting the bank angle to be
        steep. For designs where a flat batter is required to ensure rip-rap
        stability against hydraulic forces, the risk of failure by sliding of
        the rock on the filter cloth is diminished.</para>

        <para>Accordingly, care must be taken to ensure maximum resistance
        between the rip-rap and the cloth. This can be achieved by avoiding
        preparation of the bank to a smooth and even batter, not stretching
        the cloth tightly over the underlying bank, and avoiding cloths with
        low friction surfaces.</para>

      <para>In most cases of fluid motion in hydraulics, the complexity is
      such that the strict application of basic equations is possible in only
      relatively simple geometries. Analytical treatment requires the
      situation to be idealised to some extent and the effect of the
      consequent simplifications can only be tested by experiment.</para>

      <para>As a result, the science of hydraulics has been marked by intense
      development of experimental methods. Experimental observation and
      measurements, and consequent conceptual deductions, have been at the
      heart of many of the great discoveries in fluid mechanics and
      hydraulics. Along with the experimental study of basic fluid phenomena,
      the science and art of physical hydraulic modelling have
      developed.</para>

      <para>In its widest sense, all experimental hydraulics carried out in a
      laboratory comes under the umbrella of hydraulic modelling. In all such
      cases, information and insight into the behaviour of certain hydraulic
      systems are sought; often with the aim of adapting that information to
      more generalised situations or to larger scales. For the purposes of
      this chapter, however, a physical model is defined as a (usually) small
      scale replication of a prototype hydraulic situation which is used to
      understand prototype behaviour and/or to develop designs or design
      modifications to the prototype.</para>

      <para>Physical models are used by the hydraulic engineer to predict the
      characteristics of a proposed design and/or the effect of that design on
      the wider environment. In this context, the physical model is a tool for
      producing technically, environmentally, and economically optimal
      solutions for engineering problems.</para>

      <para>With the advent of widespread, powerful, and cheap computing
      facilities, numerical modelling has greatly advanced. Physical
      modelling, however, is by no means obsolete. Indeed, as discussed by
      Martins<emphasis role="bold"> </emphasis>(1989<emphasis role="bold">),
      </emphasis>the development of physical modelling has kept pace with
      numerical modelling. Often the two are intertwined through the concept
      of “hybrid modelling” where a physical model of a complex flow region
      provides the boundary conditions for a numerical model covering a much
      larger area.</para>

      <para>This chapter examines the particular application of physical
      modelling to the design of hydraulic structures and identifies
      outstanding issues that remain to be solved. The field of physical
      modelling is vast, both with regard to the range of problems tackled and
      the breadth of literature in the field. Excellent reviews and texts
      include those of Martins (1989), Kobus (1980), and Novak and Cábelka
      (1981)<emphasis role="bold">. </emphasis>Due to the vastness of the
      field, it is possible to cover only selected topics and, inevitably,
      these largely reflect the author’s range of interest and
      experience.</para>

      <para>To set the scene, general modelling criteria are first reviewed.
      In particular, the need to supplement pure dimensional analysis with
      process functions, based on sound analytical concepts, is emphasised.
      Attention is then focused on the modelling of hydraulic structures and
      the potential and implications of scale effects. Actual model studies
      are used to illustrate these issues. Finally some outstanding issues for
      further development are then identified.</para>

      identical in model and prototype. It can quickly be established,
      however, that this is not possible, especially if the same fluid is used
      in model and prototype. To move forward from this point, we make use of
      physical understanding and of a process function as follows.</para>

      <para>The first term of <xref linkend="b6_ch3_e_adr6y"/> represents the
      ratio of inertial forces to gravitational forces. Since open channel
      flow phenomena in general, and most hydraulic structure flows in
      particular, are gravity driven, this parameter must be retained.
      Requiring equality of the first term at homologous points in the model
      and the prototype leads to the well-known Froude law of modelling,
      appropriate to open channel flows, of</para>

      <para>The second term of <xref linkend="b6_ch3_e_adr6y"/> is a Weber
      number, representing the ratio of inertial forces to surface tension
      forces. This ratio increases with model size because the inertial forces
      act on a volume whereas the surface tension forces act on an area. Thus
      the surface tension forces become negligible, provided the model is
      reasonably large, and the second term can be disregarded.</para>

      <para>Turning now to the third term of <xref linkend="b6_ch3_e_adr6y"/>,
      we identify a Reynolds number, Re, representing the ratio of inertia
      forces to viscous forces. In the context of an open channel flow,
      viscous forces affect the surface resistance, apparently requiring
      Reynolds number equality between model and prototype for full

      <para>We resolve this situation by making use of a process function for
      flow resistance which links the friction factor, Reynolds number, and
      relative roughness through the well-known Colebrook-White equation. This
      function is conveniently plotted as a Moody diagram and is reproduced in
      <xref linkend="b6_ch3_f_72o81"/>.</para>

        <para>The equation for friction factor, the ordinate of <xref
        linkend="b6_ch3_f_72o81"/>, shows that the Froude criterion of <xref
        linkend="b6_ch3_e_tmrmo"/> can only be satisfied if the friction
        factor is the same in model and prototype. Superimposed on <xref
        linkend="b6_ch3_f_72o81"/> is a hypothetical range of prototype
        Reynolds numbers and a corresponding range of model operation,
        assuming a model scale of 1:25. For the example given, it is evident
        that equality of friction factor between model and prototype can only
        be obtained if the model is relatively smoother than the prototype. It
        is noted, further, that this equality is only possible for one
        particular operating condition (characterised by Reynolds number). For
        other operating conditions, the model friction factor will be
        different from that in the prototype, introducing a friction scale
        effect. The scale effect can be calculated, however, and model results
        adjusted when scaling up to prototype values.</para>

        <para><xref linkend="b6_ch3_f_72o81"/> also demonstrates that, if the
        prototype is relatively smooth, it may not be possible to build a
        model with a low enough friction factor to match that of the
        prototype. In this situation, the higher model friction factor may be
        accepted as at least conservative with respect to predicted flow
        depths, or, again, the scale effect can be calculated and used to
        adjust the predicted prototype values.</para>

        <para>The discussion above has demonstrated that dimensional analysis
        is insufficient on its own to provide a basis for the modelling of
        open channel flow. Indeed, if we relied solely on dimensional
        analysis, we would conclude that accurate modelling is not possible.
        It is only by adding our knowledge of flow resistance and its
        corresponding process function to dimensional analysis that we are
        guided to an appropriate modelling procedure.</para>

        <para>Other examples of the necessity for process functions, in
        addition to dimensional analysis, for physical modelling of weir flows
        and vortex drop shafts have been discussed by Ackers (1987)<emphasis
        role="bold">.</emphasis></para>

        <para>The discussion above applies to undistorted models only - ie
        those for which the horizontal and vertical scales are identical.
        Undistorted models are common in hydraulic structure investigations,
        but are often impractical for large rivers because of their typically
        large width:depth ratios. A typical river may have a width of 500 m
        and a depth of perhaps 2 m. The corresponding undistorted model of a
        scale of, say, 1:250 would be 2 m wide and 8 mm deep. The model flow
        is then likely to be totally different in character to the prototype
        flow due to surface tension effects and the likelihood of laminar
        model flow.</para>

        <para>This situation is resolved by utilising a vertical scale that is
        larger than the horizontal. The Froude relationship is still expressed
        in the form of <xref linkend="b6_ch3_e_tmrmo"/>, where, however, λy
        represents the vertical scale because it is vertical, rather than
        horizontal, distances which measure the effect of gravity on
        velocity.</para>

        <para>Because λy is always greater than λx, <xref
        linkend="b6_ch3_e_n84w3"/> shows that the model must be rougher than
        the prototype. Indeed, in direct contrast to undistorted models,
        significant effort is often required to make the model rough
        enough!</para>

        <para>Mobile bed models introduce an additional degree of complexity
        because the roughness of the bed is largely dependent on the form
        losses associated with the bed features. Because the bed features are
        formed by the flow conditions, and hence cannot be directly
        established by the modeller, it is important that the model flow
        conditions are such that the model bed simulates closely the bed of
        the prototype.</para>

      <para>The measured water surface elevation upstream of the flume control
      is affected by the boundary layer growth on the flume floor in that the
      water surface is displaced by a distance equal to the boundary layer
      displacement thickness. Accordingly, any dissimilarities in the
      modelling of the boundary layer displacement thickness will reflect as a

      less for the large flume than would be predicted from tests on the small

      <title>Some Issues for the Future</title>

      <para>It is fashionable in some quarters to predict the eventual demise
      of physical modelling as computing power becomes ever cheaper and more
      readily available, and as our ability to translate knowledge of the
      physics of a phenomenon into process equations for its quantitative
      solution develops. It is indeed true that some problems that were once
      routinely solved using physical models may now be solved using numerical
      models. Among these are simple spillway layouts, flow measurement
      structures, and far-field dispersion problems in rivers. It is equally
      true, however, that many problems remain the exclusive province of the
      physical modeller. Problems with complex boundary conditions and/or
      strongly three-dimensional characteristics remain extremely difficult to
      solve by numerical means. The same problems, however, are amenable to
      study by physical models because the model represents, within generally
      understood limits, an exact replica of the prototype.</para>

      <para>Developments over the next few years are likely to concentrate on
      of hybrid models – ie model approaches where physical modelling and
      numerical modelling are applied in tandem to the solution of complex
      hydraulic problems. There is evidence of this already, and two examples
      are given in the following.</para>

      <para>The mixing processes downstream of a pollutant outfall are often
      classified as “near field” and “far field”. Sometimes an additional
      “mid-field” may be introduced. Rutherford (1994) provides an excellent
      review of mixing processes.</para>

      <para>In all but the most simple of cases, near-field mixing is
      extremely difficult to model numerically. The flow field is very
      strongly three-dimensional and the mixing processes may be dominated by
      vertical mixing, transverse mixing, or both. In the far-field region,
      full vertical mixing may well have been achieved, and a numerical
      two-dimensional mixing model may be adequate to describe the continuing
      diffusion of the pollutant. In this situation, the most efficient
      modelling framework may be to build an undistorted physical model to
      simulate the near-field region and to use its measured downstream
      parameters as the upstream boundary conditions for the numerical
      model.</para>

      <para>The second example has been described by Ackers (1987)<emphasis
      role="bold"> </emphasis>and concerns prototype phenomena where air
      entrainment is a primary parameter. On spillways, we commonly permit
      self-aeration through floor slots in order to control cavitation damage
      on the spillway. The amount of air that is entrained depends on the
      length of the trajectory of the nappe which springs from the upstream
      edge of the spillway slot. However, the length of the trajectory depends
      on the air pressure beneath the nappe. This depends on the rate of air
      entrainment, which, in turn, is a function of the resistance of the air
      supply ducts. Neither of these features can be properly simulated in an
      undistorted scale model. The trick is, in fact, to link the general
      spillway model with a separate computational study of the performance of
      the ducts with a design value of air demand. The aerodynamic resistance
      of the prototype supply duct determines the pressure to be expected
      beneath the nappe and this (sub-atmospheric) pressure must then be
      reproduced artificially in the model.</para>

      busy for many years to come. Some examples are:</para>
