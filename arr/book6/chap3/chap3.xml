      this reason, the straight alignment of the river can be treated as a flood bypass channel
      during the passage of large floods. This is achieved by introducing a weir into the straight
      bypass channel that overtops when the flow exceeds a predetermined value.</para>

    <para>The design of this system requires careful consideration of the weir under drowned conditions. 
      Under low flow conditions the weir directs all river flow around the meander. However, for a given 
      design flood, the floodway and weir must pass all of the flow in excess of the capacity of the meander.</para>
    
    <para><citation>b6_c3_r1+1</citation> has developed the theoretical analysis of the drowned
      weir. The analysis has been verified by experimental studies in the laboratory and with
      limited field data by <citation>b6_c3_r2+1</citation>. The design process is assisted by the
      use of a spreadsheet based program described by <citation>b6_c3_r2+1</citation>.</para>
    
    <para>In summary, the design of a flood bypass channel must be aimed at preventing channel instability 
      in the main channel and the diversion channel. Channel design must take into account the design flows 
      and sediment transport to ensure bed and bank stability. The hydraulic design of flood bypass channels 
      can be accomplished with standard hydrology and hydraulics analysis techniques, while determinations 
      of sediment transport through the diversion are much more difficult.</para>

        Hydraulic design charts and a Manual of Practice <citation>b6_c3_r4</citation> have been

          design flood, at a specific reservoir elevation. This elevation is normally at the maximum
          operating level or at a surcharge elevation greater than the maximum operating level.

          use of a surcharge pool for passing the spillway design flood involves an economic
          analysis that considers the added cost of a dam height compared to the cost of a wider
          and/or deeper spillway. When a gated spillway is considered, the added cost of higher

          accelerations are small and the bed slope is mild. A non-hydrostatic pressure distribution
          will occur whenever the value of cos2θ departs materially from unity, such as on a steep
          spillway slope. This does not mean that the energy equation cannot be used on a steep
          slope. It does mean, however, that the designer must recognise that the values derived
          from the energy equation become increasingly inaccurate as the value of cos2θ departs

        <title>Stilling Basin Design</title>
        <para>The transition of flow from supercritical on the chute to subcritical usually involves
          considerable energy dissipation. Dissipation of hydraulic energy is accomplished by
          various methods such as the hydraulic jump, impact, dispersion, etc. The type of energy
          dissipator used is dependent upon factors that include site geology, the type of dam
          structure, and the magnitude of the energy to be dissipated. The design discharge for
          effective energy dissipation is frequently set at the standard project flood rate;
          however, each facility must be evaluated, and the design discharge used should be
          dependent upon the damage consequences when the design discharge is exceeded.</para>
        <para>Hydraulic jump stilling basins are structures located downstream of chutes, gates and
          spillways to dissipate excess kinetic energy. The dimensions of these structures depend on
          the length of the hydraulic jump and the conjugate depth of the jump. </para>
        <para><citation>b6_c3_r5+1</citation> classified the hydraulic jump into five categories
          based on the value of the upstream Froude number. On the basis of extensive experimental
          studies, he developed four types of hydraulic jump stilling basins. These are now known as
          the USBR Type 1, 2, 3, and 4 Basins. A major focus of the development of these basins was
          to reduce the size of the structure by forcing the jump to occur using blocks and end
          sills within the basin. In addition to localising the hydraulic jump, the Type 4 basin is
          designed for the special purpose of wave suppression and is not considered herein.</para>
        <para>The Type 1 Basin is a classic hydraulic jump basin without baffle blocks or an end
          sill. It is a relatively large structure and is suitable only for small upstream Froude
          numbers.</para>
        <para>When the Froude number is greater than 4.5, Type 2 or Type 3 Stilling Basins are
          recommended. The Type 2 basin incorporates a series of chute blocks at the upstream end of
          the basin to stabilise the start of the jump and to feather the incoming jet into several
          jets. At the downstream end, a continuous or dentated sill is present, designed to force
          the jump to occur within the basin and to prevent it from moving downstream. <xref

        <para>The length of the Type 2 basin is less than the length for the Type 1 basin. </para>
        <para>The Type 3 stilling basin is similar to the Type 2 basin but baffle blocks are
          included to provide additional energy dissipation by direct impact, increased turbulence
          and consequent mixing of the high velocity incoming jets into the water body of the basin.
          This results in a required basin length that is up to 60% shorter than a Type 1 basin for
          the same flow conditions. However, it should be noted that the presence of the baffle
          blocks can create conditions of cavitation in their vicinity with consequent severe
          structural damage. For this reason the Type 3 basin should not be used in conditions where

    <title>Levees</title>
    <para>Levees are embankments that are constructed to artificially increase the capacity of a
      channel, confining high flows that otherwise would overtop the banks and spread over the
      floodplain. Levees are key components of a flood control plan to protect communities and
      agricultural areas within the floodplain. Levees are used in conjunction with reservoirs,
      floodways, control structures and various channel modification activities to reduce and
      control the extent and duration of flooding.</para>
    <para>The design elevation of levees is based on containing a design discharge, generally for a
      short period of time. The levee cross section is generally designed as a trapezoid, with an
      access road running along the levee crown. To control seepage, a long, tapering berm may be
      extended on the landside of the levee as subsequently discussed. Fill material for levees is
      generally obtained locally from borrow areas adjacent to the riverside of the embankment.
      Although the local materials may not be ideally suitable for construction, economic necessity
      normally dictates its use. </para>
    <para>On streams without levees, flood flows spread out over the floodplain. The floodplain acts
      as storage for the additional flows, lowering the peak of the flood hydrograph. The
      construction of levees decreases the floodplain storage, resulting in an increase of the peak
      of the hydrograph. Furthermore, because levees typically confine river flows to a narrower
      cross section, water elevations are higher during flood flows. If levees are not set back from
      the main channel, the hydraulic connectivity between the river and the floodplain is lost,
      thus confining flows and putting more energy into the flow. The required levee height can be
      determined using industry-standard analysis programs such as HEC-RAS. Frequently it is useful
      to compare the water surface elevations for a river without levees and with levees to evaluate
      the cost-benefit of levee construction.</para>
    <para>Channel instabilities may arise from streams with levees because degradation of the bed
      and banks may occur. Sometimes, aggradation may occur due to the increased sediment load in
      the main channel and the lack of available floodplain sediment storage. The precise response
      is complex and is a function of the width of levees, the effects on duration of flows, and
      other factors.</para>
    <para>Seepage is a major problem with levees during time of high water. When water is contained
      on one side with the other side being dry, a head differential exists across the levee. This
      tends to force water through the porous soil, eventually seeping out to the landward side of
      the levee. This seepage carries both fine and coarse particles through the levee. This
      internal erosion of the levees can lead to piping through the levee and catastrophic
      failure.</para>
    <para>To prevent excessive seepage, impervious barrier materials such as clay can be built into
      the levee. Flows from tributaries that are cut off from the river system due to levees must be
      carefully assessed to prevent flooding on the landward side of the levee. Pumping stations can
      be applied to divert tributary flows.</para>
    <para>On streams without levees, flows periodically flow onto the floodplain depositing
      sediment, flushing riparian aquatic environments, and generally providing valuable habitat for
      aquatic organisms and waterfowl. The flora and fauna are adapted to periodic flooding and the
      unique environment that it creates. As noted above, levees act as a barrier for overbank
      flows. Confining stream flows within a levee system creates a dryer environment on the
      landside of the levee system and a wetter environment on the streamside. </para>
    <para>The dryer environment results in changes in both flora and fauna that occupy the
      floodplain. After a levee system is constructed, upland trees and vegetation

      the floodplain. The lands between the levee and the stream bank will experience more prolonged
      flooding with more extreme fluctuations in water level. This may inhibit the growth of ground
      cover, thus reducing the available habitat for ground-dwelling mammals
        <citation>b6_c3_r12</citation>. Frequently, for reasons of economy, material used to
      construct the levees is sourced from areas within the floodplain, resulting in vegetation
      removal and loss of habitat. The flat slopes used for levees in rural areas require large land
      requirements for the embankments and berms.</para>
    <para>To offset changes in riparian habitat, consideration can be given to the habitat provided
      by the levees themselves and the adjacent borrow pits. Traditionally, the vegetation on levees
      is kept to a minimum. However, with proper maintenance, certain species of shrubs and plants
      can be allowed to grow without affecting the integrity of the levee. However, this vegetation
      may provide habitat for burrowing animals that must be controlled. </para>
    <para>Borrow pits remaining from levee construction can serve as valuable aquatic habitat.
      Normally, the pits will fill with rainwater or groundwater after construction. Riverside
      borrow pits will exchange water with the river system, thus recharging the pit with fish and
      other aquatic organisms. In this way, borrow pits partially compensate for the loss of aquatic
      habitat in the floodplain. Additionally, siting levees further from the channel will conserve
      wetland environments between the levee and the river.</para>
    <para>Levees must be periodically inspected and maintained to provide the designed degree of
      flood protection. Conditions affecting the integrity of the levee include erosion of the
      banks, seepage, and damage from burrowing animals. Vegetation planted on the levees for
      aesthetic reasons should be well maintained. Vegetation that may affect the integrity of the
      levee should be removed.</para>
    <para>Seepage beneath the levee foundations is one of the principal causes of levee failure.
      Without control, this seepage may result in excessive hydrostatic pressures beneath an
      impervious top stratum on the landside, sand boils, and/or piping beneath the levee itself.
      Seepage problems tend to be most acute in situations where the levee is built above a pervious
      substratum, which extends both landward, and riverward of the levee and where a relatively
      thin top stratum exists on the landside of the levee. </para>
    <para>Among seepage control measures are cutoffs, riverside blankets, and landside seepage
      berms. </para>
    <section xml:id="b6_ch3_s_6hts1">
      <title>Cutoffs</title>
      <para>A cutoff beneath a levee to block seepage through pervious foundation strata is the most
        positive means of eliminating seepage problems. A cutoff may consist of an excavated trench
        backfilled with compacted earth or slurry. Trenches are usually located near the riverside
        toe. </para>
      <para>To be effective, a cutoff must penetrate at least 95 percent of the thickness of the
        pervious strata to be effective. For this reason cutoffs are rarely economical where they
        must penetrate more than about 12 m. Steel sheet piling can significantly reduce the
        possibility of piping of sand strata in the foundation, but is not always entirely
        watertight due to leakage at the interlocks between individual sheet piles. </para>
    </section>
    <section xml:id="b6_ch3_s_jv9jg">
      <title>Riverside Blankets</title>
      <para>Levees are frequently situated on foundations having natural covers of relatively
        fine-grained soils overlying pervious sands and gravels. These surface strata constitute
        impervious or semi-pervious blankets when considered in connection with seepage control. If
        these blankets are continuous and extend riverward for a considerable distance, they can
        effectively reduce seepage flow and seepage pressures on the landside of the levee. </para>
      <para>Where seepage beneath the levee is expected to be a problem, riverside borrow operations
        should be limited in depth to prevent breaching the impervious blanket. If there are limited
        areas where the blanket becomes thin or disappears entirely, the blanket can be remediated
        by placing impervious materials in these areas. The effectiveness of the blanket depends on
        its thickness, length, distance to the levee riverside toe, and permeability and can be
        evaluated by flow-net or approximate mathematical solutions <citation>b6_c3_r13</citation>.
        Protection of the riverside blanket against erosion is important.</para>

      <title>Landside Seepage Berms</title>
      <para>If uplift pressures in pervious deposits underlying an impervious top stratum landward
        of a levee become greater than the effective weight of the top stratum, heaving and
        rupturing of the top stratum may occur, resulting in sand boils. The construction of
        landside berms (where space is available) can eliminate this hazard by providing the
        additional weight needed to counteract these upward seepage forces. Furthermore, the berm
        can provide the additional length required to reduce uplift pressures at the toe of the berm
        to acceptable values. Seepage berms may reinforce an existing impervious or semi-pervious
        top stratum, or, if none exists, be placed directly on pervious deposits. A berm also
        affords some protection against degradation of the landside levee slope. </para>
      <para>Berms are relatively simple to construct and require very little maintenance. They
        frequently improve and reclaim land as areas requiring remediation treatment for seepage are
        often low and wet. Because they require additional fill material and space, they are used
        primarily with agricultural levees where land use pressures are less severe than in urban
        areas. </para>
      <para>Subsurface profiles must be carefully studied in selecting berm widths. For example,
        where a levee is founded on a thin top stratum and thicker clay deposits lie a short
        distance landward, as shown in <xref linkend="b6_ch3_f_guziz"/>, the berm should extend far
        enough landward to lap the thick clay deposit, regardless of the computed required length.
        Otherwise, a concentration of seepage and high exit gradients may occur between the berm toe
        and the landward edge of the thick clay deposit.</para>

        is normally applied in engineering practice to any large underground pipe especially where
        used in relatively short lengths to convey streams or flood water under an embankment. The
        design of culverts has been the subject of considerable research and considerable
        misunderstanding. Despite this, the culvert is such a common structure that analysis and
        design have become quite standardised. The hydraulic analysis and subsequent selection of
        the proper culvert size is aided by charts and nomographs prepared for the specific shape
        and type of culvert. These design procedures incorporate directly such factors as the
        entrance loss coefficient for a particular pipe shape and inlet configuration. </para>
      <para>The emphasis herein is on the basic analysis of culverts and is, thus, more general than
        direct recourse to design charts. It is accepted, of course, that engineers will continue to
        use the available charts and nomographs. However, the material presented herein is aimed at
        giving a better understanding of culvert flow principles and will make the use of standard
        charts and nomographs clearer and more reliable. </para>
      <para>Because a culvert is a closed conduit, it has a larger wetted perimeter than a channel.
        Accordingly, the average energy gradient through the culvert will be steeper than in the
        equivalent length of channel. In general, the only way that the steepening of the hydraulic
        gradient through the culvert can occur is by raising the water surface elevation at the
        upstream side of the embankment. </para>
      <para>However, the headwater level cannot be increased indefinitely without severe
        consequences. The consequent backwater effect may cause water to overflow the channel banks
        and cause flooding of the surrounding land. This may have severe social and economic
        repercussions. There are, however other less obvious consequences of an increase in the
        upstream water level such as bank stability, scour of the earth embankment, and erosion of
        downstream channel. </para>
      <para>It is apparent, then, that the culvert cross-sectional area and hydraulic properties are
        of great importance. It may be possible to evaluate economically the consequences of a
        headwater rise against the cost of the culvert and embankment height. Under these
        circumstances the system with the least total cost of structure and flooding should be
        selected. </para>
      <para>The factor subject to most misunderstanding in culvert design is that arising from the
        determination of the point of control – either inlet or outlet control. In some cases, the
        operating control is not clear and careful calculations are necessary to determine both the
        type of control and the various hydraulic characteristics. </para>
      <para>The hydraulic operation of culverts is complex and often difficult to predict. However,
        once the type of operation is established, the analysis may proceed according to
        well-defined principles. The factors affecting the discharge in a culvert are the following: </para>
      <orderedlist numeration="loweralpha">
        <listitem>
          <para>The geometry of the inlet.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The elevation of the outlet tailwater. </para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      <para>The flow characteristics and, hence, the discharge capacity of a culvert are determined
        by the location of the control section. In general, the discharge is controlled either at
        the culvert entrance or at the outlet and is designated inlet control and outlet control
        respectively. Inlet control will exist as long as the ability of the culvert barrel to carry
        the flow exceeds the ability of water to enter the culvert through the inlet. Outlet control
        will exist when the ability of the culvert barrel to carry water away from the entrance is
        less than the flow than can enter the inlet. The location of the control section may shift
        as the relative capacities of the entrance and barrel sections change with increasing or
        decreasing discharge.</para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Inlet control:</emphasis><emphasis role="bold"> </emphasis>With
        the inlet control operation, the discharge is independent of the pipe length, slope and
        roughness of the pipe wall. The discharge depends only upon the headwater elevation above
        the invert at the entrance, the inlet size, and the inlet geometry. Although a variation in
        factors affecting the culvert barrel will affect flow characteristics within a barrel, they
        will normally have no effect on the total discharge. The only exception occurs if the
        variations in barrel design are sufficiently severe to cause the control section to shift to
        the outlet. </para>
      <para>A culvert operating under inlet control will always flow part full for at least part of
        the culvert length. In many cases, particularly at high discharges, the headwater will
        submerge the entrance of the culvert. In these cases, flow contraction occurring at the
        entrance will limit the discharge. It should be noted that roughness, slope and length are
        not influential in determining the discharge capacity of a culvert operating with inlet
        control, but are important in determining outlet velocities and the discharge at which the
        operation mode changes from inlet control to outlet control. </para>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Outlet control:</emphasis> Under outlet control, the total
        discharge is affected by all hydraulic factors upstream of the outlet. These factors include
        the headwater elevation, entrance geometry, barrel size, wall roughness, barrel length and
        slope. The tailwater elevation is a factor as long as it is above the pipe outlet. </para>
      <para>Culverts flowing full throughout their length are always under outlet control. However,

      <para>There are several practical factors associated with culvert design which may be of equal
        importance as the hydraulic analysis. Some of these aspects are discussed in the
        following.</para>

    <section xml:id="b6_c3_s_7kmp2">
      <title>Inlet Design</title>
      <para>Full utilisation of the culvert cross-sectional area requires that it should run full or
        nearly so. This may not be possible especially in the case of low tailwater levels or steep
        gradients, leading to flow Type 5. Careful attention is then necessary in the inlet design
        to ensure minimum contraction of the flow and, hence, a maximum discharge coefficient. The
        objective is to ensure that the flow traverses the inlet section with a minimum of
        separation. </para>
      <para>A variety of methods are available for improving the inlet conditions and these include
        a steep throat, a drop inlet, wingwalls, a hood and bevelled edges. The shape of the soffit
        is the most important and of the invert, the least important, because the flow at the invert
        is horizontal. </para>
      <para>Some of these inlet improvements are illustrated schematically in <xref
          linkend="b6_ch3_f_b8szr"/>. The simplest improvement is a vertical headwall above the
        culvert entrance, thereby eliminating the re-entrant angle in the case of a battered
        embankment. The soffit of the inlet can be bevelled as shown in <xref
          linkend="b6_ch3_f_b8szr"/>(a). It is recommended that the bevel be at least 10% of the
        culvert height and at between 33° and 45° to the culvert axis <citation>b6_c3_r8</citation>.
        This can increase the flow by up to 20%. </para>
      <para>Full details and design charts and tables for improved culverts inlets may be found in a
        number of publications (e.g. <citation>b6_c3_r8+1</citation>,

      <title>Outlet Design</title>
      <para>In practice, culvert outlets have little significance in efficient culvert operation. </para>
      <para>However, outlet structures have two important practical purposes: </para>
      <orderedlist numeration="loweralpha">
        <listitem>
          <para>to retain the embankment and support the end of the culvert.</para>

            property. </para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      <para>Despite the common practice of making inlet and outlet structures identical, it should
        be noted that the two structures serve different purposes and, therefore, logically should
        be treated separately. </para>
      <para>A number of different types of culvert outlets are shown in <xref
          linkend="b6_ch3_f_af56r"/>. </para>
      <para>The simple projecting outlet is sufficient when flow velocities are low and the filldoes
        not require special protection. The endwall structure alone acts to support the end of the
        culvert and as a retaining wall for the embankment. The wingwall helps to transition the
        culvert flow smoothly into the downstream channel and protects the endwall so that it may
        continue to function in its original capacity. A concrete apron serves to provide protection
        to the endwall structure by removing the point of potential erosion well away from the
        endwall foundation, thereby ensuring the stability of the structure. </para>
      <para>Where wingwalls are used for bank protection and not merely as retaining walls, a
        concrete apron should always be provided. The absence of such an apron may encourage
        channelling and undercutting along the wingwall. </para>
      <para>Where outlet velocities are particularly high, special energy dissipation structures may
        be required. </para>
      <para>Scour at culvert outlets is not necessarily only due to concentrated flow issuing from
        the culvert barrel. Recirculating eddies, associated with a downstream channel which is
        significantly wider than the culvert, can cause potentially serious scour damage to the
        embankment fill.A further form of scour at culvert outlets is channel degradation which may
        occur if the culvert does not permit the passage of sediment from upstream. </para>
      <para>Whatever the cause, the process of erosion may be associated with the excavated material
        being redeposited in the channel some distance downstream from the point of scour. It is
        entirely possible that with time, a shoal will form capable of causing excessively high
        tailwater depths during periods of high flow. Such a process should always be considered
        because high tailwater depths may not necessarily work to the advantage of culvert
        operation. </para>

      <para>Erosive velocities vary widely, depending upon the characteristics of the channel
        material, the depth of flow in the channel, and the velocity distribution. Erosive velocity
        limits for various types of soils are published in a number of texts (e.g.
          <citation>b6_c3_r8+1</citation>). Such published values should, however, be treated with
        caution because of the vast variations in naturally occurring materials. </para>

      <para>Special problems occur in situations where relief culverts discharge directly on to an
        unchannelled flood plain. In this case, the tailwater level is likely to be significantly
        lower that the water level of the emerging supercritical jet. The erosive potential in this
        case is high and a schematic of the flow situation is shown in <xref
          linkend="b6_ch3_f_ytr1j"/>. </para>
      <para>It is apparent that the discharging jet will spread beyond the culvert and energy
        dissipation additional to bed friction will result from the interaction between the jet and
        the tailwater. The latter phenomenon is manifested in the zones of recirculation shown in
          <xref linkend="b6_ch3_f_ytr1j"/>. </para>
      <para>One method of analysis for this case has been proposed by
          <citation>b6_c3_r9+1</citation>. He drew a comparison between this phenomenon and that due
        to the interaction between shallow flood plain and deep main channel flows where the
        turbulent shear stresses are of the same order of magnitude as an equivalent wall shear
        stress if the interaction region were replaced by a solid wall. The present case can then be
        solved by assuming that the culvert outflow is contained within diverging vertical walls of
        roughness equal to that of the bed. A divergence angle of about 20° is indicated by the work
        of <citation>b6_c3_r10+1</citation> and <citation>b6_c3_r11+1</citation>. The modification
        of the outlet velocity with distance from the outlet can then be calculated using a water
        surface profile program such as HEC-RAS and appropriate invert protection determined. </para>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <para>Bridges are a necessary component of waterways that are crossed by roads and other
        embankment structures. For reasons of economy, bridges do not span the full width of a
        river, especially when it is in flood. The flow through bridges inevitably, then, involves
        energy losses that reflect in a higher water surface elevation upstream than would be the
        case if the waterway could flow freely.</para>
      <para>Despite the simple appearance of a bridge, its hydraulics is by no means simple. In
        addition to the potential for the constricted flow through a bridge site to cause flooding,
        there is a second issue of importance in the assessment of bridges and this is the issue of
        scour. Bridges continue to fail through scour of piers and/or abutments and it is vital to
        be able to determine the magnitude of this scour. Both the energy loss at a bridge site and
        the potential for scour are complex topics and special techniques have been developed to
        cope with their difficulties.</para>
      <para>It should be noted that conservatism in the design of bridge waterways for their
        flooding potential requires an under-estimate of the magnitude of scour since this will
        minimise the size of the bridge opening, maximise the velocity through the bridge, and
        maximise the energy loss across the bridge. Conversely, conservatism in assessing the
        structural integrity of the bridge requires an over-estimate of the magnitude of scour.
        Thus, it is important to keep in mind the reason for undertaking the hydraulic analysis of
        the bridge site when assessing the results of such an analysis.</para>
      <para>In this chapter, the hydraulics of flow through bridges is discussed, with special
        emphasis on energy losses and scour. A brief discussion is also presented on the bridge
        analysis routines contained within the HEC-RAS computer program.</para>

      <title>Energy Losses at Bridges</title>
      <para>Energy losses at bridge sites have three components. The first consists of losses that
        occur in the reach immediately downstream from the structure where an expansion of flow
        takes place. The second component comprises the losses that occur at the structure itself.
        The third component comprises the losses that occur in the reach immediately upstream of the
        structure where the flow is contracting to pass through the bridge opening. These three
        components are illustrated in <xref linkend="b6_ch3_f_j0ucv"/>. </para>

        <para>Bridge losses within the expansion reach downstream (sections 1 to 2) can be
          relatively large. The region is characterised by recirculation zones on either side that
          are maintained by extracting energy from the mean flow. Energy losses through the
          contraction (sections 3 to 4) are relatively smaller because the channel length over which
          the change in cross-section occurs is less and the recirculation zones are smaller. </para>
        <para>Within each of these regions the energy loss is normally calculated as the sum of
          friction losses and expansion or contraction losses. Friction and contraction losses
          between sections 3 and 4 are calculated the same as friction and expansion losses between
          sections 1 and 2. Friction losses are typically determined using standard step profile
          equations. Contraction and expansion losses are described in terms of a coefficient times
          the absolute value of the change in velocity head between adjacent cross sections. For a
          detailed discussion on selecting contraction and expansion coefficients at bridges, the
          user is referred to Chapter 5 of the HEC-RAS Hydraulic Reference Manual. </para>
        <para>Within the bridge structure itself (between sections 2 and 3) the computation of the
          energy loss can be simple or complex, depending on the flow characteristics. A low flow,
          where the water surface does not interact with the bottom chord of the bridge, may be
          analysed using a simple standard step procedure. On the other hand, interaction of the
          water surface with the bridge deck structure may lead to a combination of low flow and
          weir flow or pressure flow and weir flow. These cases require more complex modelling
          techniques that are outside the scope of this section. Modelling details may be found in
          the HEC-RAS Hydraulic Reference Manual. </para>
        <para>In most cases of flow through bridge sites, the river flow downstream and upstream is
          sub-critical. Under these circumstances, the hydraulic effect of the bridge is to increase
          the water level upstream of the bridge, with no effect downstream. On the other hand, in
          the rare cases where the natural flow is characterised by super-critical conditions, the
          effect of the bridge manifests downstream. In such cases, upstream water levels are
          affected only if the bridge constriction is sufficiently severe to transform the
          supercritical flow to subcritical. </para>
        <para>It is noted that the bridge routines in HEC-RAS allow the modeller to analyse a bridge
          with several different methods without changing the bridge geometry. The bridge routines
          have the ability to model low flow, low flow and weir flow (with adjustments for
          submergence), pressure flow (orifice and sluice gate equations), pressure and weir flow,
          and high flows with the energy equation only. HEC-RAS modelling also allows for multiple
          bridge openings at a single location. </para>

        presented in the following. </para>
      <para> A perched bridge is one for which the road approaching the bridge is at the flood plain
        ground level, and only in the immediate area of the bridge does the road rise above ground
        level to span the water course. This condition is shown schematically in <xref

      <para>A typical flow situation with this type of bridge is low flow under the bridge and
        overbank flow around the bridge. Because the road approaching the bridge is usually not much
        higher than the surrounding ground, the assumption of weir flow is usually not justified. </para>
      <para>For this reason, perched bridges should generally be modelled using the energy-based
        method, especially when a large percentage of the total flow rate is carried in the overbank
        areas. </para>
      <para>A submerged bridge (or low water bridge) is designed to accommodate only low flows under
        the bridge. Flood flows are carried over the bridge and road. A typical example of a

        of the bridge, the correction for submergence can introduce considerable error. For this

        patterns. However, for larger angles of skew, the flow efficiency decreases. For reasonably

        These cost related performance factors should be considered as well as trafficability and
        other requirements in the selection of final road level. Floodways may offer environmental
        advantages over culverts or bridges, since they will tend to spread flows more widely. This
        means that the risk of scour to waterway and surrounding land is generally reduced because
        flow is less concentrated. It is also important that a floodway be designed so that it is

      <para>It is important that adequate approach sight distance be provided to allow drivers time
        to recognise water over the road and to stop. It is also important that the length of a
        floodway be limited at about 300 m so that drivers do not become disorientated when
        confronted with wide open stretches of water. Where a proposed floodway would be longer than
        300 m, it is recommended that the proposed floodway be broken into shorter lengths by
        providing sections of road that are raised above the maximum flood level. As a general
        principle, floodways should be designed so that the depth of water over the road should be
        as uniform as possible over the flooded section. Building a floodway on a level grade avoids
        the possibility of a driver unexpectedly encountering deeper water and possibly stalling or
        being swept downstream.</para>

      <para>The biggest and most frequently encountered scour-related problems usually concern loose
        sediments that are easily eroded. It is not true, however, to assume that the scour depth in
        cohesive or cemented soils cannot be as large – it merely takes longer for the scour hole to
        develop.</para>
      <para>Many of the equations for scour were derived from laboratory studies, for which the
        range of validity is unknown. Some were verified using very limited field data, which itself
        may be of doubtful accuracy. In the field, the scour hole that develops on the rising stage
        of a flood, or at the peak, may be filled in again on the falling stage. For this reason,
        the maximum depth of scour cannot be easily assessed after the event.</para>
      <para>Scour can also cause problems with the hydraulic analysis of a bridge. Scour may
        considerably deepen the channel through a bridge and effectively reduce or even eliminate
        the backwater. This reduction in backwater should not be relied on, however, because of the
        unpredictable nature of the processes involved.</para>
      <para>When considering scour it is normal to distinguish between non-cohesive or cohesionless
        (alluvial) sediments and cohesive material. The former are usually of most interest and are
        considered further in this section. Cohesive materials require special techniques and are
        outside the scope of this chapter.</para>

        scour. The critical issue here is whether or not the mean bed shear stress of the flow
        upstream of the bridge is less than or larger than the threshold value needed to move the
        bed material.</para>
      <para>If the upstream shear stress is less than the threshold value, the bed material upstream
        of the bridge is at rest. This is referred to as the clear-water condition because the
        approach flow is clear and does not contain sediment. Thus, any bed material that is removed
        from a local scour hole is not replaced by sediment being transported by the approach flow.
        The maximum local scour depth is achieved when the size of the scour hole results in a local
        reduction in shear stress to the critical value such that the flow can no longer remove bed
        material from the scoured area.</para>
      <para>Live-bed scour occurs where the upstream shear stress is greater than the threshold
        value and the bed material upstream of the crossing is moving. This means that the approach
        flow continuously transports sediment into a local scour hole. By itself, a live bed in a
        uniform channel will not cause a scour hole - for this to be created some additional
        increase in shear stress is needed, such as that caused by a contraction (natural or
        artificial, such as a bridge) or a local obstruction
        (<?oxy_delete author="RadhikaChhotai" timestamp="20160614T150243+1000" content="e.g."?><?oxy_insert_start author="RadhikaChhotai" timestamp="20160614T150243+1000"?>eg.<?oxy_insert_end?>
        a bridge pier). The equilibrium scour depth is achieved when material is transported into
        the scour hole at the same rate at which it is transported out.</para>

      <para>At any particular location both clear-water and live-bed scour may be experienced.
        During a single flood the bed shear stress will increase and decrease as the discharge rises
        and falls. Thus, it is possible to have clear-water conditions initially, then a live bed,
        then finally clear water again. The maximum scour depth may occur under clear-water
        conditions, not at the flood peak when live-bed scour is experienced. Similarly, relatively
        high velocities can be experienced when the flow is just contained within the banks, rather
        than spread over the floodplains at the peak discharge.</para>
      <para>It is also possible to have the clear-water and live-bed conditions occurring at the
        same time. For example, if the floodplains are grassed or composed of material that is
        larger in diameter than that in the main channel, clear-water conditions may occur on the
        floodplain with live-bed conditions in the main channel.</para>
      <para>It is evident from this discussion that the problem may not always be as simple or as
        well defined as would be desirable. If there are any uncertainties or if the consequences of
        failure are large, prompting a conservative approach, it is recommended that clear-water
        conditions be assumed at the peak flow condition.</para>
      <para>Urbanisation has the effect of increasing flood magnitudes and causing hydrographs to
        peak earlier, resulting in higher stream velocities and degradation. Channel improvements or
        the extraction of gravel (above or below the site in question) can alter water levels, flow
        velocities, bed slopes and sediment transport characteristics and consequently affect scour.
        For instance, if an alluvial channel is straightened, widened or altered in any other way
        that results in an increased flow-energy condition, the channel will tend back towards a
        lower energy state by degrading upstream, widening and aggrading downstream.</para>
      <para>The significance of degradation scour to bridge design is that the engineer has to
        decide whether the existing channel elevation is likely to be constant over the 100 year
        life of the bridge, or whether it will change. If change is probable then it must be allowed
        for when designing the waterway and foundations.</para>
      <para> The lateral stability of a river channel may also affect scour depths, because movement
        of the channel may result in the bridge being incorrectly positioned or aligned with respect
        to the approach flow. This problem can be significant under any circumstances but is
        potentially very serious in arid or semi-arid regions and with ephemeral (intermittent)
        streams. Lateral migration rates are largely unpredictable. Sometimes a channel that has
        been stable for many years may suddenly start to move, but significant influences are
        floods, bank material, vegetation of the banks and floodplains, and land use.</para>
      <para>Scour at bridge sites is typically classified as contraction (or constriction) scour and
        local scour. Contraction scour occurs over a whole cross-section as a result of the
        increased velocities and bed shear stresses arising from a narrowing of the channel by a
        constriction such as a bridge. In general, the smaller the opening ratio (<inlineequation>

        If the flow contracts from a wide floodplain, considerable scour and bank failure can occur.
        Relatively severe constrictions may require regular maintenance for decades to combat
        erosion. It is evident that one way to reduce contraction scour is to make the opening
        wider.</para>
      <para>Contraction scour is caused by a constriction in the floodplain either by a bridge or
        when overbank flow is confined by road embankments. A decrease in flow area results in an
        increase in average velocity and bed shear stress. Contraction scour is different from
        long-term degradation in that contraction scour occurs in the vicinity of the constriction
        (bridge), it may be intermittent, and/or related to the passing of a particular flood
        event.</para>

        accelerates around the corners of abutments, piers and spur dykes. The flow pattern around a
        cylindrical pier is shown in <xref linkend="b6_ch3_f_8_3"/>. The approaching flow
        decelerates as it nears the cylinder, coming to rest at the centre of the pier. The
        resulting stagnation pressure is highest near the water surface where the approach velocity
        is greatest, and smaller lower down. The downward pressure gradient at the pier face directs
        the flow downwards. Local pier scour begins when the downflow velocity near the stagnation
        point is strong enough to overcome the resistance to motion of the bed particles.</para>

      <para>When scour occurs the maximum downflow velocity is about 80% of the mean approach
        velocity. The impact of the downflow on the bed is the principal factor leading to the
        creation of a scour hole. As the hole grows the flow dives down and around the pier
        producing a horseshoe vortex, which carries the scoured bed material downstream.</para>
      <para>The combination of the downflow with the horseshoe vortex is the dominant scour
        mechanism. As the scour hole becomes progressively deeper the downflow near the bottom of
        the scour hole decreases until at some point in time equilibrium is reached and the depth
        remains constant.</para>
      <para>At the sides of the pier flow separation occurs, resulting in a wake vortex whose
        whirlpool action sucks up sediment from the bed. As the vortices diminish and velocities
        reduce, the scoured material is deposited some distance downstream of the pier.</para>
      <para>For piers that are essentially rectangular in plan and aligned to the flow the basic
        scour mechanism is similar to that just described, although rather more severe because of
        the square corners. However, as the angle of attack to a rectangular pier increases, so does
        its effective width, so the scour depth increases and the point of maximum scour moves
        downstream of the nose to a point on the exposed side.</para>
      <para>With a large degree of skew the maximum scour may occur at the downstream end of the
        pier. If the flow direction is likely to change there is merit in using cylindrical piers to
        avoid these complications.</para>
      <para>The scour mechanism at a bridge abutment is similar to that at a pier, although the
        boundary layer at the abutment or channel wall may result in an additional deceleration of
        the flow compared with a central pier. The approach flow can be considered as separating
        into an upper layer, which forms an upflow surface roller on hitting the abutment, and a
        lower layer, which becomes the bottom or principal vortex. This is shown schematically in
          <xref linkend="b6_ch3_f_8_4"/>.</para>

      <para>Viewed in plan, the upper layer divides or separates, with part of the flow accelerating
        around the upstream corner of the abutment into the bridge waterway while the remainder
        slowly rotates in an almost stationary pool trapped against the face of the abutment and the
        river bank.</para>
      <para>In the bottom layer, the flow near the bank forms an almost vertical downflow, while
        that nearer to the end of the abutment accelerates down and into the waterway, forming the
        principal vortex. Usually scouring starts in this region of accelerating flow and grows
        along the faces of the abutment. Wake vortices form downstream of the abutment.</para>
      <para>The basic scouring process is the same for most types of abutment, although with
        wingwall and vertical wall types the stagnation region is larger, and scour is most severe
        near the end of the abutment where the principal vortex is concentrated.</para>
      <para>The total scour depth is obtained by summing degradation, contraction and local scour.
        This procedure is, strictly, only valid where the scour holes overlap. For instance,
        contraction scour may have to be added to pier or abutment scour to get the total scour
        depth. However, pier scour and abutment scour would not be added unless the two scour holes
        overlap.</para>
      <para>This usually has to be determined by drawing a cross-section through the waterway and
        superimposing the scour depths. If the holes do overlap the resultant scour depth is often
        larger than the two components, but difficult to predict. Nevertheless, as a general and
        conservative rule, the total scour depth is the sum of the three components.</para>
      <para>The scour computation capability in the HEC-RAS software allows the user to compute
        contraction scour and local scour at piers and abutments. The details may be found in the

        structural damage from scour can create safety hazards as well as significant social impacts

      <para>Encroachment in the stream channel by abutments and piers reduces the channel section

        cause approach embankment failures and serious contraction scour in the bridge waterway,

        floodplains the design should seek to avoid excessive diversion of floodplain flows towards
        the main bridge opening and skewed crossings of floodplains should also be minimised as much

      <para>Normally the scour protection is used to fill any scour holes that have formed to the

        once a failure mode commences. </para>
      <para>If shotcrete (concrete) is used at the bridge abutments for scour repair it must be tied
        into the abutment slope. If it is not properly tied into the slope it can be undermined and
        result in further damage to the abutment. This method is often not effective, particularly
        where the scour is being caused by a geotechnical failure of the embankment slopes. </para>

      <title>Scour protection for culverts</title>
      <para>Culverts concentrate flow and also allow an increase in flood level upstream of the
        embankment. These factors increase the flow velocity at the culvert outlet compared to the
        natural velocity in the channel. If this increase produces a velocity where scour could be
        introduced, protection measures are required, though good practice would lead to a design
        solution where the culvert design maintains a flow velocity at the outlet that is below the

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <para>Sharp-crested weirs are often used to measure flow in open channels. Among their
        advantages, are that they are easy to install, accurate, and relatively inexpensive.</para>
      <para>They do, however, have a major disadvantage in flows containing substantial amounts of
        sediment, in that they trap sediment and other solids behind them, leading to putrescible
        deposits in sewer applications. For this reason, sharp-crested weirs are most commonly used
        with relatively clean effluent, or in temporary flow monitoring locations.</para>
      <para>The emphasis in this sub-section is on the analytical techniques, weir properties, and
        choice for particular purposes, and submergence characteristics. In particular, complete
        details on variations in discharge coefficient are not given, and the reader is referred to

      <para>The analysis of the sharp-crested weir is best illustrated by reference to a weir

      <para>It is noted first that the pressure distribution at the weir crest is non-hydrostatic.
        This situation arises because the pressure at both Points A and B is atmospheric by
        definition, and there are significant vertical components in the velocity as the flow
        contracts to pass over the weir crest.</para>
      <para>Secondly, it is noted that, as expected, the total energy line (TEL) is situated an
        elevation <inlineequation>

      <title>Broad-crested Weirs and Long-Throated Flumes</title>
      <para>Because critical flow represents a unique relationship between depth and flow rate,
        devices which induce critical flow are often used to measure flow in open channels. Most of
        these devices, however, require calibration in the laboratory because the flow
        characteristics are not in accordance with the usual theoretical assumptions.</para>
      <para>Chief among these is the assumption that the pressure distribution is hydrostatic. In
        many devices, the strongly curved stream lines negate this assumption, resulting in the
        necessity for empirical coefficients.</para>
      <para>The broad-crested weir and the long-throated flume are devices for which the flow rate
        can be predicted theoretically without the need for such coefficients. The broadness of the
        crest and the length of the throat are such that the stream lines are close to horizontal in
        the region of critical flow, permitting the assumption that the pressure distribution is
        hydrostatic.</para>
      <para>The analysis of both the broad-crested weir and the long-throated flume is identical in
        that both rely on the determination of the relationship between the upstream water level
        (which may be measured) and critical depth within the constricted section – which is a known
        function of the flow rate. Thus, a unique relationship between flow rate and the upstream
        water surface elevation can be determined.</para>
      <para>Broad-crested weirs are more prone to sediment buildup than long-throated flumes and
        are, consequently, less common in sewerage systems. For this reason, the emphasis in the
        following is on long-throated flumes, while recognising that broad-crested weirs are
        analysed in the same manner.</para>
      <para>The long-throated flume is widely used in sewerage systems, within the pipe system and
        to monitor open channel inflows and outflows at sewage treatment plants.</para>
      <para>In this section, the advantages of this type of structure are first discussed. The
        derivation of the theoretical rating curve is then presented for the rectangular flume and
        it is shown how this can be generalised for arbitrary cross-section shape. Their use in
        practice is then illustrated.</para>

          <para>Provided that critical flow occurs in the throat, a rating table can be calculated
            with an error of less than 2% in the listed discharge. This can be done for any
            combination of a prismatic throat and an arbitrarily-shaped approach channel.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>The throat, perpendicular to the direction of flow, can be shaped in such a way that

      <para>The major property of a long-throated flume is that it is designed to create a
        constriction in the flow area sufficient to produce critical flow over the full range of
        expected flow rates. In addition, the head loss across the structure should not be excessive

          has the same size and algebraic sign for every measurement.</para>
        <para>Systematic uncertainties may be due to such things as incorrect calibration of an
          instrument, consistently improper use of equipment or failure to properly account for some
          effect. A systematic uncertainty is a true error and large systematic errors can and must
          be eliminated in a good experiment. Every effort should be made to

        <para>The effect that random uncertainties have on results can be somewhat reduced by taking
          repeated measurements then calculating their average. The average is generally considered

          compensate each other in the averaging process. They yield results distributed about some
          mean value.</para>
        <para>A measurement with relatively small random uncertainty is said to have high precision.
          A measurement with small random uncertainty and small systematic error is said to have
          high accuracy. Precision does not necessarily imply accuracy. A precise measurement may be
          inaccurate if it has a systematic error.</para>

        <title>Determination of Flow Rate Uncertainty from Uncertainty in Measured Head</title>
        <para>Frequently, the assessed flow rate will not be measured directly. Rather, it will be
          determined through a functional relationship from a measurement of head with its own
          uncertainty. The question is: What is the resulting uncertainty in the assessed flow
          rate?</para>
        <para>The answer depends on the equation linking the flow rate with the directly measured
          parameters. We first return to the functional relationship derived for the rectangular
          sharp-crested weir:</para>
