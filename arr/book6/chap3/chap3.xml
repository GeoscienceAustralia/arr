    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>Hydraulic structures are used to guide and control water flow velocities, directions and
      depths, the elevation and slope of the streambed, the general configuration of the waterway,
      and its stability and maintenance characteristics. </para>
    <para>Careful and thorough hydraulic engineering is justified for hydraulic structures and
      consideration of environmental, ecological and public safety objectives should be integrated
      with hydraulic engineering design. The proper application of hydraulic structures can reduce
      initial and future maintenance costs by managing the character of the flow to fit the
      environmental and project needs. </para>
    <para>Examples of hydraulic structures include flow measurement structures, transitions,
      constrictions, channel drops, low-flow checks, energy dissipators, bridges, bends, and
      confluences. Their shape, size, and other features vary widely for different projects,
      depending upon the discharge and the function to be accomplished. Hydraulic design procedures
      must govern the final design of all structures. These may include model testing for larger
      structures when the proposed design requires a configuration that differs significantly from
      known documented guidelines or when questions arise over the character of the structure being
      considered. </para>
    <para>This review is necessarily abbreviated because the general field of hydraulic structures
      is vast so attention herein is focused on some of those structures of most importance in the
      urban and rural setting. For this reason such structures as large dams are not considered.
      Hydraulic structures covered include flood bypass channels, control structures (gates, weirs
      and flumes, and spillways), levees, culverts, bridge waterways, floodways on roads, scour,
      rock chutes, rock riprap, and flow measurement structures. The review concludes with a
      discussion of physical modelling and its particular application to hydraulic structure
      design.</para>

    <title>Flood Bypass Channels</title>
    <para>Diversion channels are utilized to divert waters from the main channel for a variety of
      purposes including flood control, municipal water supply, and irrigation. The term “flood
      bypass channel” is typically used to describe a separate channel into which floodwaters are
      directed to lessen the impact of flooding on the main river system. Such channels may bypass
      the flood flows into an adjacent waterway or return the flows back into the same stream a
      distance downstream from the point of the diversion. On large river systems, flood bypass
      channels may simply comprise adjacent low-lying areas or old river courses. Typically, control
      structures may be located at the head of the diversion channel to divert flows during periods
      of high water and return flows after the flood has passed. Flood bypass channels are often
      used in urban areas where it is not possible to widen the existing channel due to development. </para>
    <para>Design considerations for flood bypass channels include:</para>
    <para>• Determination of the percentage of the flood flow that should be carried by the bypass
      channel. </para>
    <para>• Design of appropriate controls.</para>
    <para>• Determination of the size of the channel to convey the design discharge.</para>
    <para>• Design the channel to reduce maintenance.</para>
    <para>To be effective in reducing the flood stage, the distance between the point of diversion
      and point of return to the main channel must be of sufficient length to prevent backwater
      effects. Additionally, it is essential to consider potential morphologic effects on both the
      main channel and receiving channel.</para>
    <para>Flood bypass channels generally have steeper slopes than the main channel and this may
      lead to stability problems such as erosion of the channel bed and banks. The bed of tributary
      channels may be higher than that of the floodway channel, and bed degradation may migrate
      upstream of the tributary, resulting in excessive sediment transport and deposition in the
      floodway. Methods to mitigate channel instability such as grade control, channel lining and
      bank stabilization may be required on diversion projects.</para>
    <para>Additionally, diversion flows can have an adverse impact on the main channel. If the flow
      rate is reduced in the main channel due to a diversion then, noting that the main channel
      slope and particle size remain constant, the sediment transport capacity of the main channel
      will decrease. This, in turn, could lead to aggradation in the main channel between the point
      of the diversion and the point of re-entry. If too much bed material is diverted, the sediment
      transport capability of the stream may increase with resultant increase in channel
      instability. Flow returning to the main channel from a diversion can also result in
      accelerated erosion of the channel and banks around the point of re-entry. For these reasons
      it is essential that a detailed geomorphic and sediment transport analysis be conducted at the
      design stage of a diversion project to plan for potential problems.</para>
    <para>There are many environmental benefits in using a flood bypass channel as an alternative to
      modifying the main channel to convey flood flows. The original stream substrate and meanders
      are maintained, as well as in-stream cover and riparian vegetation. If designed only for
      occasional flood flows, the bypass channel can have multiple social and lifestyle benefits
      such as an urban greenbelt or sports and recreation areas.</para>
    <para>One major application of flood bypass channels is in the reinstatement of meandering
      channels. Many previously meandering rivers in Australia have been artificially straightened,
      thereby increasing the gradient of the river channel. The effect of this is to increase the
      conveyance of the river channel, thereby improving the drainage of the land and reducing the
      frequency and duration of overbank flooding. The consequences include deepening and widening
      and consequent instability of the main channel and a major decline of ecological
      function.</para>
    <para>Where the original meanders are still available, there is a significant focus on
      redirecting the river channel flow back into the meanders, thereby “renaturalising” the river.
      Normally, however, the meanders have a significantly reduced flow capacity because they have
      become filled in to a large extent during the years that the river has been straightened. For
      this reason, the straight alignment of the river can be treated as a flood bypass channel
      during the passage of large floods. This is achieved by introducing a weir into the straight
      bypass channel that overtops when the flow exceeds a predetermined value.</para>

      floodway and weir.</para>

    </figure>
    <para>The design of this system requires careful consideration of the weir under drowned
      conditions. Under low flow conditions the weir directs all river flow around the meander.
      However, for a given design flood, the floodway and weir must pass all of the flow in excess
      of the capacity of the meander.</para>
    <para>Keller (1995) has developed the theoretical analysis of the drowned weir. The analysis has
      been verified by experimental studies in the laboratory and with limited field data by Keller
      et al (2012). The design process is assisted by the use of a spreadsheet based program
      described by Keller et al (2012).</para>
    <para>In summary, the design of a flood bypass channel must be aimed at preventing channel
      instability in the main channel and the diversion channel. Channel design must take into
      account the design flows and sediment transport to ensure bed and bank stability. The
      hydraulic design of flood bypass channels can be accomplished with standard hydrology and
      hydraulics analysis techniques, while determinations of sediment transport through the
      diversion are much more difficult. </para>

    <title>Control structures – Gates, weirs and flumes and spillways</title>
    <para>Sluice gates and other control gatesSluice gates are used to control the flow in rivers
      and artificial channels and are sometimes referred to as underflow gates because the flow
      passes under the gate and control is exercised by lowering the gate. In addition to
      controlling the flow rate, gates can be used for flow measurement if they are calibrated by
      field measurement or by model testing.Figure 2 shows three different types of underflow gates
      – the vertical sluice gate, the radial (or Tainter) gate, and the drum gate.</para>

      </mediaobject>
    </figure>
    <para>The choice of gate in a particular situation depends on a number of factors. The vertical
      sluice gate is the simplest to construct, but has the disadvantage of requiring an expensive
      guide system to transmit the hydraulic thrust to the side-walls. The radial gate is better in
      this respect because the thrust is carried through the radial arms to the hinge. Drum gates
      are hollow gate sections that float on water and are pinned to rotate up or down. Water is
      allowed into or out of the flotation chamber to allow the gate to, respectively, fall or
      rise.</para>
    <para>Flow through an underflow gate may be classified as free outflow or submerged outflow and
      the analysis for each is different.</para>
    <section xml:id="b6_ch3_s_8qw9o">
    <title>Free Outflow</title>
    <para>Free outflow conditions occur when the issuing jet of supercritical flow is open to the
      atmosphere and this is shown schematically in Figure 3.</para>

    <para>The sluice gate is a case of rapidly varied flow in which large variations in depth and
      velocity occur over a short length of channel. Furthermore, because the flow contracts
      smoothly under the gate with a minimum of turbulence, energy losses are negligible and the
      energy level can be assumed to be the same on both sides of the gate.</para>

      then the gate outlet must become drowned, defined as the condition where subcritical flow
      impinges on the downstream side of the gate. The effect is that the jet of water issuing from

      there will be some energy loss between Sections 1 and 2, a much greater proportion of the

      when it is assumed that all of the energy loss occurs between Sections 2 and 3.</para>

    <title>Weirs and flumes</title>
    <para>Weirs and flumes are often used for flow measurement, as noted in the section of this
      chapter on Flow Measurement Structures. However, because the design of these structures
      involves the application of a known relationship between flow rate and water surface
      elevation, they can also be employed as control structures – used to control the water level,
      or water level range, for a given flow rate, or flow rate range.</para>
    <para>In this context, the design of the structures follows the same procedure as developed
      earlier. In particular, broad-crested weirs are robust structures that span the full width of
      the channel and are normally constructed of reinforced concrete. Especially for flow control
      in relatively large rivers, they are normally preferred over sharp-crested weirs, which can be
      easily damaged. Furthermore, because it is a critical depth meter, the broad-crested weir has
      the advantage that it operates effectively with higher downstream water levels than a
      sharp-crested weir.</para>
    <para>For relatively small open channels, the long-throated flume is a better alternative than a
      weir and is capable of measuring relatively large flows. It is basically a width constriction
      that, in plan, a rounded converging section, a parallel throat section, and a diverging

    <para>The design of a long-throated flume requires some compromise between ensuring that the
      throat is narrow enough to control the flow without submergence, but not so narrow that it
      creates unacceptable afflux.</para>
    <para>As noted in the section of this chapter on Flow Measurement Structures the analysis of
      both the broad-crested weir and the long-throated flume is identical in that both rely on the
      determination of the relationship between the upstream water level (which may be measured) and
      critical depth within the constricted section – which is a known function of the flow rate.
      Thus, a unique relationship between flow rate and the upstream water surface elevation can be
      determined. </para>

    <title>Spillways</title>
    <para>Flow behaviour on spillways has been investigated extensively by the US Army Corps of
      Engineers Waterways Experiment Station since the early 1950s (USACE-WES, 1952). Hydraulic
      design charts and a Manual of Practice (USACE, 1995) have been prepared, enabling the design
      of a spillway profile and a water surface profile for a given design flood condition. However,
      the design charts are only applicable for certain types of spillway profiles and pier
      configurations and cover a limited range of flood levels. </para>
    <para>In the past, this limitation was overcome by building scaled physical models to
      investigate the flow behaviour. These models have tended to include both the spillway and any
      associated energy dissipation structure. Physical models are considered elsewhere in this
      chapter. More advanced mathematical models may also be appropriate and these are also
      discussed elsewhere in this Book.</para>
    <para>A spillway is ideally designed so that, when operating at its design head, the pressure at
      the spillway surface is atmospheric. Consequentially, when the reservoir level is below or
      above the design flood level, the pressure over the spillway will be above or below
      atmospheric respectively. In the latter case, the negative pressures may create unstable
      conditions on the spillway surface and damage due to cavitation. </para>
    <para>Existing dams and spillways in Australia were designed and constructed to handle estimated
      design floods. Since their construction, the increase to, and reanalysis of, hydrological data
      have lead in many cases to a revision upwards of the design floods, requiring major upgrades
      to spillway capacity.</para>
    <para>To select the optimum upgrade design, many dam owners have needed to consider the most
      cost-effective way to analyse the behaviour of the spillway flow under conditions of increased
      maximum flood. In many cases, as in the original design, use has been made of physical scale
      models.</para>
    <para>With appropriate recognition of scale effects, physical models have been the upgrade
      design method of choice. However, the use of numerical methods is attractive in terms of lower
      cost and substantially reduced preparation time. Additionally, results can be obtained
      throughout the flow domain rather than at selected monitoring locations.</para>

      <title>Design</title>
    <para>A spillway is sized to provide the required capacity, usually the entire spillway design
      flood, at a specific reservoir elevation. This elevation is normally at the maximum operating
      level or at a surcharge elevation greater than the maximum operating level. Hydraulic design
      of a spillway usually involves four conditions of flow, each occurring at a different location
      as follows:</para>
    <orderedlist>

        <para>Subcritical flow in the spillway approach, initially at a low velocity, accelerating,
          however, as it approaches the crest.</para>

      </listitem>
    </orderedlist>
    <para>When a relatively large storage capacity can be obtained above the normal maximum
      reservoir elevation by increasing the dam height, a portion of the flood volume can be stored
      in this reservoir surcharge space and the size of the spillway can be reduced. The use of a
      surcharge pool for passing the spillway design flood involves an economic analysis that
      considers the added cost of a dam height compared to the cost of a wider and/or deeper
      spillway. When a gated spillway is considered, the added cost of higher and/or additional
      gates and piers must be compared to the cost of additional dam height.</para>
    <para>When an un-gated spillway is considered, the cost of reduced flood-control benefits due to
      a reduction in reservoir storage must be compared to the cost of additional dam height. </para>

          that the energy equation cannot be used on a steep slope. It does mean, however, that the

          increasingly inaccurate as the value of cos2θ departs further from unity. This conditions

      development. Boundary roughness is normally dealt with using a standard friction loss equation

    <title>Stilling Basin
      Design</title>
    <para>The transition of flow from supercritical on the chute to subcritical usually involves
      considerable energy dissipation. Dissipation of hydraulic energy is accomplished by various
      methods such as the hydraulic jump, impact, dispersion, etc. The type of energy dissipator
      used is dependent upon factors that include site geology, the type of dam structure, and the
      magnitude of the energy to be dissipated. The design discharge for effective energy
      dissipation is frequently set at the standard project flood rate; however, each facility must
      be evaluated, and the design discharge used should be dependent upon the damage consequences
      when the design discharge is exceeded.</para>
    <para>Hydraulic jump stilling basins are structures located downstream of chutes, gates and
      spillways to dissipate excess kinetic energy. The dimensions of these structures depend on the
      length of the hydraulic jump and the conjugate depth of the jump. </para>
    <para>Peterka (1978) classified the hydraulic jump into five categories based on the value of
      the upstream Froude number. On the basis of extensive experimental studies, he developed four
      types of hydraulic jump stilling basins. These are now known as the USBR Type 1, 2, 3, and 4
      Basins. A major focus of the development of these basins was to reduce the size of the
      structure by forcing the jump to occur using blocks and end sills within the basin.</para>
    <para>The Type 1 Basin is a classic hydraulic jump basin without baffle blocks or an end sill.
      It is a relatively large structure and is suitable only for small upstream Froude
      numbers.</para>
    <para>When the Froude number is greater than 4.5, Type 2 or Type 3 Stilling Basins are
      recommended. The Type 2 basin incorporates a series of chute blocks at the upstream end of the
      basin to stabilise the start of the jump and to feather the incoming jet into several jets. At
      the downstream end, a continuous or dentated sill is present, designed to force the jump to
      occur within the basin and to prevent it from moving downstream. Figure 5 shows a schematic of
      the Type 2 Basin. In this figure, y<subscript>2</subscript> is the required conjugate
      downstream depth.</para>

      required basin length that is up to 60% shorter than a Type 1 basin for the same flow
      conditions. However, it should be noted that the presence of the baffle blocks can create
      conditions of cavitation in their vicinity with consequent severe structural damage. For this
      reason the Type 3 basin should not be used in conditions where the incoming velocity exceeds
      16m/s. Figure 6 shows a schematic of a Type 3 Basin.</para>

    <title>Levees</title>
    <para>Levees are embankments that are constructed to artificially increase the capacity of a
      channel, confining high flows that otherwise would overtop the banks and spread over the
      floodplain. Levees are key components of a flood control plan to protect communities and
      agricultural areas within the floodplain. Levees are used in conjunction with reservoirs,
      floodways, control structures and various channel modification activities to reduce and
      control the extent and duration of flooding.</para>
    <para>The design elevation of levees is based on containing a design discharge, generally for a
      short period of time. The levee cross section is generally designed as a trapezoid, with an
      access road running along the levee crown. To control seepage, a long, tapering berm may be
      extended on the landside of the levee as subsequently discussed. Fill material for levees is
      generally obtained locally from borrow areas adjacent to the riverside of the embankment.
      Although the local materials may not be ideally suitable for construction, economic necessity
      normally dictates its use. </para>
    <para>On streams without levees, flood flows spread out over the floodplain. The floodplain acts
      as storage for the additional flows, lowering the peak of the flood hydrograph. The
      construction of levees decreases the floodplain storage, resulting in an increase of the peak
      of the hydrograph. Furthermore, because levees typically confine river flows to a narrower
      cross section, water elevations are higher during flood flows. If levees are not set back from
      the main channel, the hydraulic connectivity between the river and the floodplain is lost,
      thus confining flows and putting more energy into the flow. The required levee height can be
      determined using industry-standard analysis programs such as HEC-RAS. Frequently it is useful
      to compare the water surface elevations for a river without levees and with levees to evaluate
      the cost-benefit of levee construction.</para>
    <para>Channel instabilities may arise from streams with levees because degradation of the bed
      and banks may occur. Sometimes, aggradation may occur due to the increased sediment load in
      the main channel and the lack of available floodplain sediment storage. The precise response
      is complex and is a function of the width of levees, the effects on duration of flows, and
      other factors.</para>
    <para>Seepage is a major problem with levees during time of high water. When water is contained
      on one side with the other side being dry, a head differential exists across the levee. This
      tends to force water through the porous soil, eventually seeping out to the landward side of
      the levee. This seepage carries both fine and coarse particles through the levee. This
      internal erosion of the levees can lead to piping through the levee and catastrophic
      failure.</para>
    <para>To prevent excessive seepage, impervious barrier materials such as clay can be built into
      the levee. Flows from tributaries that are cut off from the river system due to levees must be
      carefully assessed to prevent flooding on the landward side of the levee. Pumping stations can
      be applied to divert tributary flows.</para>
    <para>On streams without levees, flows periodically flow onto the floodplain depositing
      sediment, flushing riparian aquatic environments, and generally providing valuable habitat for
      aquatic organisms and waterfowl. The flora and fauna are adapted to periodic flooding and the
      unique environment that it creates. As noted above, levees act as a barrier for overbank
      flows. Confining stream flows within a levee system creates a dryer environment on the
      landside of the levee system and a wetter environment on the streamside. </para>
    <para>The dryer environment results in changes in both flora and fauna that occupy the
      floodplain. After a levee system is constructed, upland trees and vegetation colonize the
      floodplain. The lands between the levee and the stream bank will experience more prolonged
      flooding with more extreme fluctuations in water level. This may inhibit the growth of ground
      cover, thus reducing the available habitat for ground-dwelling mammals (Fredrickson, 1979).
      Frequently, for reasons of economy, material used to construct the levees is sourced from
      areas within the floodplain, resulting in vegetation removal and loss of habitat. The flat
      slopes used for levees in rural areas require large land requirements for the embankments and
      berms.</para>
    <para>To offset changes in riparian habitat, consideration can be given to the habitat provided
      by the levees themselves and the adjacent borrow pits. Traditionally, the vegetation on levees
      is kept to a minimum. However, with proper maintenance, certain species of shrubs and plants
      can be allowed to grow without affecting the integrity of the levee. However, this vegetation
      may provide habitat for burrowing animals that must be controlled. </para>
    <para>Borrow pits remaining from levee construction can serve as valuable aquatic habitat.
      Normally, the pits will fill with rainwater or groundwater after construction. Riverside
      borrow pits will exchange water with the river system, thus recharging the pit with fish and
      other aquatic organisms. In this way, borrow pits partially compensate for the loss of aquatic
      habitat in the floodplain. Additionally, siting levees further from the channel will conserve
      wetland environments between the levee and the river.</para>
    <para>Levees must be periodically inspected and maintained to provide the designed degree of
      flood protection. Conditions affecting the integrity of the levee include erosion of the
      banks, seepage, and damage from burrowing animals. Vegetation planted on the levees for
      aesthetic reasons should be well maintained. Vegetation that may affect the integrity of the
      levee should be removed.</para>
    <para>Seepage beneath the levee foundations is one of the principal causes of levee failure.
      Without control, this seepage may result in excessive hydrostatic pressures beneath an
      impervious top stratum on the landside, sand boils, and/or piping beneath the levee itself.
      Seepage problems tend to be most acute in situations where the levee is built above a pervious
      substratum, which extends both landward, and riverward of the levee and where a relatively
      thin top stratum exists on the landside of the levee. </para>
    <para>Among seepage control measures are cutoffs, riverside blankets, and landside seepage
      berms. </para>
    <section xml:id="b6_ch3_s_6hts1">
    <title>Cutoffs</title>
    <para>A cutoff beneath a levee to block seepage through pervious foundation strata is the most
      positive means of eliminating seepage problems. A cutoff may consist of an excavated trench
      backfilled with compacted earth or slurry. Trenches are usually located near the riverside
      toe. </para>
    <para>To be effective, a cutoff must penetrate at least 95 percent of the thickness of the
      pervious strata to be effective. For this reason cutoffs are rarely economical where they must
      penetrate more than about 12 m. Steel sheet piling can significantly reduce the possibility of
      piping of sand strata in the foundation, but is not always entirely watertight due to leakage
      at the interlocks between individual sheet piles. </para>

    <title>Riverside
      Blankets</title>
    <para>Levees are frequently situated on foundations having natural covers of relatively
      fine-grained soils overlying pervious sands and gravels. These surface strata constitute
      impervious or semi-pervious blankets when considered in connection with seepage control. If
      these blankets are continuous and extend riverward for a considerable distance, they can
      effectively reduce seepage flow and seepage pressures on the landside of the levee. </para>
    <para>Where seepage beneath the levee is expected to be a problem, riverside borrow operations
      should be limited in depth to prevent breaching the impervious blanket. If there are limited
      areas where the blanket becomes thin or disappears entirely, the blanket can be remediated by
      placing impervious materials in these areas. The effectiveness of the blanket depends on its
      thickness, length, distance to the levee riverside toe, and permeability and can be evaluated
      by flow-net or approximate mathematical solutions (USACE, 2000). Protection of the riverside
      blanket against erosion is important.</para>

    <title>Landside Seepage
      Berms</title>
    <para>If uplift pressures in pervious deposits underlying an impervious top stratum landward of
      a levee become greater than the effective weight of the top stratum, heaving and rupturing of
      the top stratum may occur, resulting in sand boils. The construction of landside berms (where
      space is available) can eliminate this hazard by providing the additional weight needed to
      counteract these upward seepage forces. Furthermore, the berm can provide the additional
      length required to reduce uplift pressures at the toe of the berm to acceptable values.
      Seepage berms may reinforce an existing impervious or semi-pervious top stratum, or, if none
      exists, be placed directly on pervious deposits. A berm also affords some protection against
      degradation of the landside levee slope. </para>
    <para>Berms are relatively simple to construct and require very little maintenance. They
      frequently improve and reclaim land as areas requiring remediation treatment for seepage are
      often low and wet. Because they require additional fill material and space, they are used
      primarily with agricultural levees where land use pressures are less severe than in urban
      areas. </para>
    <para>Subsurface profiles must be carefully studied in selecting berm widths. For example, where
      a levee is founded on a thin top stratum and thicker clay deposits lie a short distance
      landward, as shown in Figure 7, the berm should extend far enough landward to lap the thick
      clay deposit, regardless of the computed required length. Otherwise, a concentration of
      seepage and high exit gradients may occur between the berm toe and the landward edge of the
      thick clay deposit.</para>

    <title>Culverts</title>

    <section xml:id="b6_ch3_s_j9gih">
      <title>Culvert Flow Principles</title>
      <para>The term “culvert” is normally applied in engineering practice to any large underground
        pipe especially where used in relatively short lengths to convey streams or flood water
        under an embankment. The design of culverts has been the subject of considerable research
        and considerable misunderstanding. Despite this, the culvert is such a common structure that
        analysis and design have become quite standardised. The hydraulic analysis and subsequent
        selection of the proper culvert size is aided by charts and nomographs prepared for the
        specific shape and type of culvert. These design procedures incorporate directly such
        factors as the entrance loss coefficient for a particular pipe shape and inlet
        configuration. </para>
      <para>The emphasis herein is on the basic analysis of culverts and is, thus, more general than
        direct recourse to design charts. It is accepted, of course, that engineers will continue to
        use the available charts and nomographs. However, the material presented herein is aimed at
        giving a better understanding of culvert flow principles and will make the use of standard
        charts and nomographs clearer and more reliable. </para>
      <para>Because a culvert is a closed conduit, it has a larger wetted perimeter than a channel.
        Accordingly, the average energy gradient through the culvert will be steeper than in the
        equivalent length of channel. In general, the only way that the steepening of the hydraulic
        gradient through the culvert can occur is by raising the water surface elevation at the
        upstream side of the embankment. </para>
      <para>However, the headwater level cannot be increased indefinitely without severe
        consequences. The consequent backwater effect may cause water to overflow the channel banks
        and cause flooding of the surrounding land. This may have severe social and economic
        repercussions. There are, however other less obvious consequences of an increase in the
        upstream water level such as bank stability, scour of the earth embankment, and erosion of
        downstream channel. </para>
      <para>It is apparent, then, that the culvert cross-sectional area and hydraulic properties are
        of great importance. It may be possible to evaluate economically the consequences of a
        headwater rise against the cost of the culvert and embankment height. Under these
        circumstances the system with the least total cost of structure and flooding should be
        selected. </para>
      <para>The factor subject to most misunderstanding in culvert design is that arising from the
        determination of the point of control – either inlet or outlet control. In some cases, the
        operating control is not clear and careful calculations are necessary to determine both the
        type of control and the various hydraulic characteristics. </para>
      <para>The hydraulic operation of culverts is complex and often difficult to predict. However,

          <para>The flow characteristics and, hence, the discharge capacity of a culvert are
            determined by the location of the control section. In general, the discharge is
            controlled either at the culvert entrance or at the outlet and is designated inlet
            control and outlet control respectively. Inlet control will exist as long as the ability
            of the culvert barrel to carry the flow exceeds the ability of water to enter the
            culvert through the inlet. Outlet control will exist when the ability of the culvert
            barrel to carry water away from the entrance is less than the flow than can enter the
            inlet. The location of the control section may shift as the relative capacities of the
            entrance and barrel sections change with increasing or decreasing discharge.</para>
     

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Inlet control:</emphasis><emphasis role="bold"> </emphasis>With
        the inlet control operation, the discharge is independent of the pipe length, slope and
        roughness of the pipe wall. The discharge depends only upon the headwater elevation above
        the invert at the entrance, the inlet size, and the inlet geometry. Although a variation in
        factors affecting the culvert barrel will affect flow characteristics within a barrel, they
        will normally have no effect on the total discharge. The only exception occurs if the
        variations in barrel design are sufficiently severe to cause the control section to shift to
        the outlet. </para>
      <para>A culvert operating under inlet control will always flow part full for at least part of
        the culvert length. In many cases, particularly at high discharges, the headwater will
        submerge the entrance of the culvert. In these cases, flow contraction occurring at the
        entrance will limit the discharge. It should be noted that roughness, slope and length are
        not influential in determining the discharge capacity of a culvert operating with inlet
        control, but are important in determining outlet velocities and the discharge at which the
        operation mode changes from inlet control to outlet control. </para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Outlet control:</emphasis> Under outlet control, the total
        discharge is affected by all hydraulic factors upstream of the outlet. These factors include
        the headwater elevation, entrance geometry, barrel size, wall roughness, barrel length and
        slope. The tailwater elevation is a factor as long as it is above the pipe outlet. </para>
      <para>Culverts flowing full throughout their length are always under outlet control. However,
        as will be shown, a culvert flowing part full may operate under either inlet control or
        outlet control. </para>

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Hydraulic Analysis: </emphasis>For computational convenience, flow
        through culverts is divided into size categories based on the relative heights of the head
        and tailwater and, for three of the categories, on barrel slope. The six types of flow are
        shown schematically in <xref linkend="b6_ch3_f_p7lmk"/> and their respective characteristics
        are summarised in <xref linkend="b6_ch3_t_9zycu"/>. In the table, D is the maximum vertical

        accepted and several texts suggest a limiting value of 1.2. This lower limit is probably
        more appropriate since it allows for effects of factors such as wave motion or transitory
        debris blockage for example. </para>

      <para>Notes on the analysis and practical implications of each of the
      flow types shown in <xref linkend="b6_ch3_f_p7lmk"/> are presented in
      the following. Flow types 1, 2 and 3 are considered briefly only because
      they are not normally encountered under design conditions.</para>

      barrel capacity.</para>

      <para><emphasis><emphasis role="bold">Flow Types 1, 2 and 3:</emphasis></emphasis> Because
        these three cases comprise open channel flow throughout the culvert length, their complete
        analysis requires an evaluation of the water surface profile by standard methods [see e.g.
        Reference (1)]. In practice, however, simpler techniques may be practicable. </para>

      for box culverts with wingwalls are presented in <xref linkend="b6_ch3_t_7nuz5"/>. Standard tables or charts may be used for

      <para><emphasis role="bold">Flow Type 6:</emphasis> This flow type
      differs from Flow Type 4 only in that the outlet runs free. However, the

      <para>In many given design situations the control type (i.e inlet or outlet) will be obvious.
        Occasionally, however, this will not be the case. Where it is not obvious the evaluation is
        best made by assuming both cases and comparing the results. In the analysis of a given
        culvert, the resulting discharge given values of headwater and tailwater or the value of
        headwater given tailwater and discharge, would be the usual goals. If the discharge is
        determined by assuming both inlet and outlet control, the lower of the two values would
        prevail. Correspondingly, if the value of headwater is needed, then the higher would
        prevail. The design problem of selecting a satisfactory culvert size would be based on
        evaluating both types of control and choosing the larger indicated size. </para>
      <para>In this section the methods of culvert analysis for various <emphasis role="italic">flow

        reasonably accurate results. In assessing the accuracy of the calculations, however, the

          culvert entrance. Over the next 1,500 m, the invert has a uniform slope of 1:2500. The
          culvert then discharges into a tailwater pool whose surface level is 3 m above the invert
          level at the downstream end of the culvert. The culvert is made of concrete of k<subscript>s</subscript> = 1.5
          mm. A schematic is shown in Figure 9. Find the discharge in the culvert when the headwater

        <para>There are several practical factors associated with culvert
        design which may be of equal importance as the hydraulic analysis.
        Some of these aspects are discussed in the following.</para>

        <section xml:id="b6_c3_s_7kmp2">
          <title>Inlet Design</title>
          <para>Full utilisation of the culvert cross-sectional area requires that it should run
            full or nearly so. This may not be possible especially in the case of low tailwater
            levels or steep gradients, leading to flow Type 5. Careful attention is then necessary
            in the inlet design to ensure minimum contraction of the flow and, hence, a maximum
            discharge coefficient. The objective is to ensure that the flow traverses the inlet
            section with a minimum of separation. </para>
          <para>A variety of methods are available for improving the inlet conditions and these
            include a steep throat, a drop inlet, wingwalls, a hood and bevelled edges. The shape of
            the soffit is the most important and of the invert, the least important, because the
            flow at the invert is horizontal. </para>
          <para>Some of these inlet improvements are illustrated schematically in Figure 10. The
            simplest improvement is a vertical headwall above the culvert entrance, thereby
            eliminating the re-entrant angle in the case of a battered embankment. The soffit of the
            inlet can be bevelled as shown in Figure 10(a). It is recommended that the bevel be at
            least 10% of the culvert height and at between 33° and 45° to the culvert axis (3). This
            can increase the flow by up to 20%. </para>
          <para>Full details and design charts and tables for improved culverts inlets may be found
            in a number of publications [e.g (2), (3)]. </para>

          <title>Outlet Design</title>
          <para>In practice, culvert outlets have little significance in efficient culvert
            operation. </para>
          <para>However, outlet structures have two important practical purposes: </para>

          </orderedlist>
          <para>Despite the common practice of making inlet and outlet structures identical, it
            should be noted that the two structures serve different purposes and, therefore,
            logically should be treated separately. </para>
          <para>A number of different types of culvert outlets are shown in Figure 11. </para>
          <para>The simple projecting outlet is sufficient when flow velocities are low and the
            filldoes not require special protection. The endwall structure alone acts to support the
            end of the culvert and as a retaining wall for the embankment. The wingwall helps to
            transition the culvert flow smoothly into the downstream channel and protects the
            endwall so that it may continue to function in its original capacity. A concrete apron
            serves to provide protection to the endwall structure by removing the point of potential
            erosion well away from the endwall foundation, thereby ensuring the stability of the
            structure. </para>
          <para>Where wingwalls are used for bank protection and not merely as retaining walls, a
            concrete apron should always be provided. The absence of such an apron may encourage
            channelling and undercutting along the wingwall. </para>
          <para>Where outlet velocities are particularly high, special energy dissipation structures
            may be required. </para>
          <para>Scour at culvert outlets is not necessarily only due to concentrated flow issuing
            from the culvert barrel. Recirculating eddies, associated with a downstream channel
            which is significantly wider than the culvert, can cause potentially serious scour
            damage to the embankment fill.A further form of scour at culvert outlets is channel
            degradation which may occur if the culvert does not permit the passage of sediment from
            upstream. </para>
          <para>Whatever the cause, the process of erosion may be associated with the excavated
            material being redeposited in the channel some distance downstream from the point of
            scour. It is entirely possible that with time, a shoal will form capable of causing
            excessively high tailwater depths during periods of high flow. Such a process should
            always be considered because high tailwater depths may not necessarily work to the
            advantage of culvert operation. </para>

          <para>Erosive velocities vary widely, depending upon the characteristics of the channel
            material, the depth of flow in the channel, and the velocity distribution. Erosive
            velocity limits for various types of soils are published in a number of texts [e.g.
            Reference (3)]. Such published values should, however, be treated with caution because
            of the vast variations in naturally occurring materials. </para>
          <para>Special problems occur in situations where relief culverts discharge directly on to
            an unchannelled flood plain. In this case, the tailwater level is likely to be
            significantly lower that the water level of the emerging supercritical jet. The erosive
            potential in this case is high and a schematic of the flow situation is shown in Figure
            12. </para>
          <para>It is apparent that the discharging jet will spread beyond the culvert and energy
            dissipation additional to bed friction will result from the interaction between the jet
            and the tailwater. The latter phenomenon is manifested in the zones of recirculation
            shown in Figure 12. </para>
          <para>One method of analysis for this case has been proposed by Keller (4). He drew a
            comparison between this phenomenon and that due to the interaction between shallow flood
            plain and deep main channel flows where the turbulent shear stresses are of the same
            order of magnitude as an equivalent wall shear stress if the interaction region were
            replaced by a solid wall. The present case can then be solved by assuming that the
            culvert outflow is contained within diverging vertical walls of roughness equal to that
            of the bed. A divergence angle of about 20° is indicated by the work of Rouse et al. (5)
            and List and Imberger (6). The modification of the outlet velocity with distance from
            the outlet can then be calculated using a water surface profile program such as HEC-RAS
            and appropriate invert protection determined. </para>

    <title>Bridge Waterways</title>

      <title>Introduction</title>

      <para>Bridges are a necessary component of waterways that are crossed by
      roads and other embankment structures. For reasons of economy, bridges
      do not span the full width of a river, especially when it is in flood.
      The flow through bridges inevitably, then, involves energy losses that
      reflect in a higher water surface elevation upstream than would be the
      case if the waterway could flow freely.</para>

      <para>Despite the simple appearance of a bridge, its hydraulics is by no
      means simple. In addition to the potential for the constricted flow
      through a bridge site to cause flooding, there is a second issue of
      importance in the assessment of bridges and this is the issue of scour.
      Bridges continue to fail through scour of piers and/or abutments and it
      is vital to be able to determine the magnitude of this scour. Both the
      energy loss at a bridge site and the potential for scour are complex
      topics and special techniques have been developed to cope with their
      difficulties.</para>

      <para>It should be noted that conservatism in the design of bridge
      waterways for their flooding potential requires an under-estimate of the
      magnitude of scour since this will minimise the size of the bridge
      opening, maximise the velocity through the bridge, and maximise the
      energy loss across the bridge. Conversely, conservatism in assessing the
      structural integrity of the bridge requires an over-estimate of the
      magnitude of scour. Thus, it is important to keep in mind the reason for
      undertaking the hydraulic analysis of the bridge site when assessing the
      results of such an analysis.</para>

      <para>In this chapter, the hydraulics of flow through bridges is
      discussed, with special emphasis on energy losses and scour. A brief
      discussion is also presented on the bridge analysis routines contained
      within the HEC-RAS computer program.</para>

      <title>Energy Losses at Bridges</title>

      <para>Energy losses at bridge sites have three components. The first consists of losses that
        occur in the reach immediately downstream from the structure where an expansion of flow
        takes place. The second component comprises the losses that occur at the structure itself.
        The third component comprises the losses that occur in the reach immediately upstream of the
        structure where the flow is contracting to pass through the bridge opening. These three
        components are illustrated in Figure 13. </para>

        <para>Bridge losses within the expansion reach downstream (sections 1 to 2) can be
          relatively large. The region is characterised by recirculation zones on either side that
          are maintained by extracting energy from the mean flow. Energy losses through the
          contraction (sections 3 to 4) are relatively smaller because the channel length over which
          the change in cross-section occurs is less and the recirculation zones are smaller. </para>
        <para>Within each of these regions the energy loss is normally calculated as the sum of
          friction losses and expansion or contraction losses. Friction and contraction losses
          between sections 3 and 4 are calculated the same as friction and expansion losses between
          sections 1 and 2. Friction losses are typically determined using standard step profile
          equations. Contraction and expansion losses are described in terms of a coefficient times
          the absolute value of the change in velocity head between adjacent cross sections. For a
          detailed discussion on selecting contraction and expansion coefficients at bridges, the
          user is referred to Chapter 5of the HEC-RAS Hydraulic Reference Manual. </para>
        <para>Within the bridge structure itself (between sections 2 and 3) the computation of the
          energy loss can be simple or complex, depending on the flow characteristics. A low flow,
          where the water surface does not interact with the bottom chord of the bridge, may be
          analysed using a simple standard step procedure. On the other hand, interaction of the
          water surface with the bridge deck structure may lead to a combination of low flow and
          weir flow or pressure flow and weir flow. These cases require more complex modelling
          techniques that are outside the scope of this section. Modelling details may be found in
          the HEC-RAS Hydraulic Reference Manual. </para>
        <para>In most cases of flow through bridge sites, the river flow downstream and upstream is
          sub-critical. Under these circumstances, the hydraulic effect of the bridge is to increase
          the water level upstream of the bridge, with no effect downstream. On the other hand, in
          the rare cases where the natural flow is characterised by super-critical conditions, the
          effect of the bridge manifests downstream. In such cases, upstream water levels are
          affected only if the bridge constriction is sufficiently severe to transform the
          supercritical flow to subcritical. </para>
        <para>It is noted that the bridge routines in HEC-RAS allow the modeller to analyse a bridge
          with several different methods without changing the bridge geometry. The bridge routines
          have the ability to model low flow, low flow and weir flow (with adjustments for
          submergence), pressure flow (orifice and sluice gate equations), pressure and weir flow,
          and high flows with the energy equation only. HEC-RAS modelling also allows for multiple
          bridge openings at a single location. </para>

        presented in the following. </para>
      <para> A perched bridge is one for which the road approaching the bridge is at the flood plain
        ground level, and only in the immediate area of the bridge does the road rise above ground
        level to span the water course. This condition is shown schematically in Figure14. </para>

      <para>A typical flow situation with this type of bridge is low flow under the bridge and

      <para>For this reason, perched bridges should generally be modelled using the energy-based
        method, especially when a large percentage of the total flow rate is carried in the overbank
        areas. </para>

        the bridge. Flood flows are carried over the bridge and road. A typical example of a

      <para>Scour can be defined simply as the excavation and removal of material from the bed and
        banks of streams as a result of the erosive action of flowing water. In the context of this
        book, it is assumed that this erosive action may potentially expose the foundations of a
        bridge. Scour is usually considered to be a local phenomenon, but includes degradation that
        can cause erosion over a considerable length of a river. </para>
      <para>Scour is a very serious problem. Floods that result in scour are the principal cause of
        bridge failure. </para>
      <para>Some of the observable effects of scour are shown in Figure 20. Figure 20(a) shows the
        pier caps and pile caps exposed. Figure 20(b) shows pier and abutment riprap moved

        a downstream scour hole arising from submergence of the opening. Figure 20(e) shows slumped
        material at the toe of the bank arising from failure of the riprap or bank. Figure 20(f)

      <para>The biggest and most frequently encountered scour-related problems usually concern loose
        sediments that are easily eroded. It is not true, however, to assume that the scour depth in
        cohesive or cemented soils cannot be as large – it merely takes longer for the scour hole to
        develop. </para>
      <para>Many of the equations for scour were derived from laboratory studies, for which the
        range of validity is unknown. Some were verified using very limited field data, which itself
        may be of doubtful accuracy. In the field, the scour hole that develops on the rising stage
        of a flood, or at the peak, may be filled in again on the falling stage. For this reason,
        the maximum depth of scour cannot be easily assessed after the event. </para>
      <para>Scour can also cause problems with the hydraulic analysis of a bridge. Scour may
        considerably deepen the channel through a bridge and effectively reduce or even eliminate
        the backwater. This reduction in backwater should not be relied on, however, because of the
        unpredictable nature of the processes involved. </para>
      <para>When considering scour it is normal to distinguish between non-cohesive or cohesionless
        (alluvial) sediments and cohesive material. The former are usually of most interest and are
        considered further in this section. Cohesive materials require special techniques and are
        outside the scope of this chapter. </para>
      <para>The first major issue when considering scour is the distinction between <emphasis role="bold">clear-water</emphasis> scour and <emphasis role="bold">live-bed</emphasis>
        scour. The critical issue here is whether or not the mean bed shear stress of the flow
        upstream of the bridge is less than or larger than the threshold value needed to move the
        bed material. </para>
      <para>If the upstream shear stress is less than the threshold value, the bed material upstream
        of the bridge is at rest. This is referred to as the clear-water condition because the
        approach flow is clear and does not contain sediment. Thus, any bed material that is removed
        from a local scour hole is not replaced by sediment being transported by the approach flow.
        The maximum local scour depth is achieved when the size of the scour hole results in a local
        reduction in shear stress to the critical value such that the flow can no longer remove bed
        material from the scoured area. </para>
      <para>Live-bed scour occurs where the upstream shear stress is greater than the threshold
        valueand the bed material upstream of the crossing is moving. This means that the approach
        flow continuously transports sediment into a local scour hole. By itself, a live bed in a
        uniform channel will not cause a scour hole - for this to be created some additional
        increase in shear stress is needed, such as that caused by a contraction (natural or
        artificial, such as a bridge) or a local obstruction (e.g. a bridge pier). The equilibrium
        scour depth is achieved when material is transported into the scour hole at the same rate at
        which it is transported out. </para>
      <para>These concepts are illustrated by Figure 21. </para>

      <para>It is noted from Figure 21 that typically the maximum equilibrium clear-water scour is

      <para>At any particular location both clear-water and live-bed scour may be experienced.
        During a single flood the bed shear stress will increase and decrease as the discharge rises
        and falls. Thus, it is possible to have clear-water conditions initially, then a live bed,
        then finally clear water again. The maximum scour depth may occur under clear-water
        conditions, not at the flood peak when live-bed scour is experienced. Similarly, relatively
        high velocities can be experienced when the flow is just contained within the banks, rather
        than spread over the floodplains at the peak discharge. </para>
      <para> It is also possible to have the clear-water and live-bed conditions occurring at the
        same time. For example, if the floodplains are grassed or composed of material that is
        larger in diameter than that in the main channel, clear-water conditions may occur on the
        floodplain with live-bed conditions in the main channel. </para>
      <para>It is evident from this discussion that the problem may not always be as simple or as
        well defined as would be desirable. If there are any uncertainties or if the consequences of
        failure are large, prompting a conservative approach, it is recommended that clear-water
        conditions be assumed at the peak flow condition. </para>
      <para>Urbanisation has the effect of increasing flood magnitudes and causing hydrographs to
        peak earlier, resulting in higher stream velocities and degradation. Channel improvements or
        the extraction of gravel (above or below the site in question) can alter water levels, flow
        velocities, bed slopes and sediment transport characteristics and consequently affect scour.
        For instance, if an alluvial channel is straightened, widened or altered in any other way
        that results in an increased flow-energy condition, the channel will tend back towards a
        lower energy state by degrading upstream, widening and aggrading downstream. </para>
      <para>The significance of degradation scour to bridge design is that the engineer has to
        decide whether the existing channel elevation is likely to be constant over the 100 year
        life of the bridge, or whether it will change. If change is probable then it must be allowed
        for when designing the waterway and foundations. </para>
      <para>The lateral stability of a river channel may also affect scour depths, because movement
        of the channel may result in the bridge being incorrectly positioned or aligned with respect
        to the approach flow. This problem can be significant under any circumstances but is
        potentially very serious in arid or semi-arid regions and with ephemeral (intermittent)
        streams. Lateral migration rates are largely unpredictable. Sometimes a channel that has
        been stable for many years may suddenly start to move, but significant influences are
        floods, bank material, vegetation of the banks and floodplains, and land use. </para>
      <para>Scour at bridge sites is typically classified as contraction (or constriction) scour and
        local scour. Contraction scour occurs over a whole cross-section as a result of the
        increased velocities and bed shear stresses arising from a narrowing of the channel by a
        constriction such as a bridge. In general, the smaller the opening ratio (<inlineequation>

        If the flow contracts from a wide floodplain, considerable scour and bank failure can occur.
        Relatively severe constrictions may require regular maintenance for decades to combat
        erosion. It is evident that one way to reduce contraction scour is to make the opening
        wider. </para>
      <para>Local scour arises from the increased velocities and associated vortices as water
        accelerates around the corners of abutments, piers and spur dykes. The flow pattern around a
        cylindrical pier is shown in Figure 22. The approaching flow decelerates as it nears the
        cylinder, coming to rest at the centre of the pier. The resulting stagnation pressure is
        highest near the water surface where the approach velocity is greatest, and smaller lower
        down. The downward pressure gradient at the pier face directs the flow downwards. Local pier
        scour begins when the downflow velocity near the stagnation point is strong enough to
        overcome the resistance to motion of the bed particles.</para>

        recorded just below bed level. When scour occurs the maximum downflow velocity is about 80%
        of the mean approach velocity. The impact of the downflow on the bed is the principal factor
        leading to the creation of a scour hole. As the hole grows the flow dives down and around
        the pier producing a horseshoe vortex, which carries the scoured bed material downstream. </para>
      <para>The combination of the downflow with the horseshoe vortex is the dominant scour
        mechanism. As the scour hole becomes progressively deeper the downflow near the bottom of
        the scour hole decreases until at some point in time equilibrium is reached and the depth
        remains constant. </para>
      <para>At the sides of the pier flow separation occurs, resulting in a wake vortex whose
        whirlpool action sucks up sediment from the bed. As the vortices diminish and velocities
        reduce, the scoured material is deposited some distance downstream of the pier. </para>
      <para>For piers that are essentially rectangular in plan and aligned to the flow the basic
        scour mechanism is similar to that just described, although rather more severe because of
        the square corners. However, as the angle of attack to a rectangular pier increases, so does
        its effective width, so the scour depth increases and the point of maximum scour moves
        downstream of the nose to a point on the exposed side. </para>
      <para>With a large degree of skew the maximum scour may occur at the downstream end of the
        pier. If the flow direction is likely to change there is merit in using cylindrical piers to
        avoid these complications. </para>
      <para>The scour mechanism at a bridge abutment is similar to that at a pier, although the
        boundary layer at the abutment or channel wall may result in an additional deceleration of
        the flow compared with a central pier. The approach flow can be considered as separating
        into an upper layer, which forms an upflow surface roller on hitting the abutment, and a
        lower layer, which becomes the bottom or principal vortex. This is shown schematically in
        Figure 23. </para>

      <para>Viewed in plan, the upper layer divides or separates, with part of the flow accelerating
        around the upstream corner of the abutment into the bridge waterway while the remainder
        slowly rotates in an almost stationary pool trapped against the face of the abutment and the
        river bank. </para>
      <para>In the bottom layer, the flow near the bank forms an almost vertical downflow, while
        that nearer to the end of the abutment accelerates down and into the waterway, forming the
        principal vortex. Usually scouring starts in this region of accelerating flow and grows
        along the faces of the abutment. Wake vortices form downstream of the abutment. </para>
      <para>The basic scouring process is the same for most types of abutment, although with
        wingwall and vertical wall types the stagnation region is larger, and scour is most severe
        near the end of the abutment where the principal vortex is concentrated. </para>
      <para>The total scour depth is obtained by summing degradation, contraction and local scour.
        This procedure is, strictly, only valid where the scour holes overlap. For instance,
        contraction scour may have to be added to pier or abutment scour to get the total scour
        depth. However, pier scour and abutment scour would not be added unless the two scour holes
        overlap. </para>
      <para>This usually has to be determined by drawing a cross-section through the waterway and
        superimposing the scour depths. If the holes do overlap the resultant scour depth is often
        larger than the two components, but difficult to predict. Nevertheless, as a general and

    <title>Floodways on Roads</title>
    <section xml:id="b6_ch3_s_jht5e">
      <title>Introduction</title>
      <para>Floodways are sections of roads which have been designed to be overtopped by floodwater
        during relatively high annual exceedance probability flood events. These events could be as
        high as AEP 10% to 5%, but are often designed for overtopping in small floods.</para>
      <para>Floodways are therefore planned for locations where flood immunity is not a serious
        concern or the duration of road closure is low, and are suitable for locations where
        extensive floodplain width and shallow flows make bridge or culvert construction difficult
        or expensive. Floodways are often a preferred approach for locations where a relatively
        cheap floodplain crossing is needed and where flood immunity or flood closures are not e
        significant concern. They are therefore often preferred for roads with low traffic volumes
        in arid regions where flood events are infrequent and short duration.</para>
      <para>The Queensland Department of Transport and Main Roads Road Drainage Manual has detailed
        guidance on floodway design (QDTMR, 2010).</para>
      <para>Floodways may require costly batter protection and therefore a higher level road
        together with a larger culvert or bridge option may be more cost effective. Floodways also
        have smaller waterway (under road) requirements and may be more prone to blockage by debris.
        These cost related performance factors should be considered as well as trafficability and
        other requirements in the selection of final road level. Floodways may offer environmental
        advantages over culverts or bridges, since they will tend to spread flows more widely. This
        means that the risk of scour to waterway and surrounding land is generally reduced because
        flow is less concentrated. It is also important that a floodway be designed so that it is
        not covered by water from ponding or backwater for any significant period of time after a
        flood event.</para>

      <para>It is important that adequate approach sight distance be provided to allow drivers time
        to recognise water over the road and to stop. It is also important that the length of a
        floodway be limited at about 300 m so that drivers do not become disorientated when
        confronted with wide open stretches of water. Where a proposed floodway would be longer than
        300 m, it is recommended that the proposed floodway be broken into shorter lengths by
        providing sections of road that are raised above the maximum flood level. As a general
        principle, floodways should be designed so that the depth of water over the road should be
        as uniform as possible over the flooded section. Building a floodway on a level grade avoids
        the possibility of a driver unexpectedly encountering deeper water and possibly stalling or
        being swept downstream.</para>

      <para>Scour results from the erosive action of flowing water, which excavates and carries away
        material from the bed and banks of streams and from around the piers and abutments of
        bridges. Different river bed materials scour at different rates, and under flow conditions
        typical of actual bridge crossings, several flood events are needed to reach ultimate scour.
        Determining the magnitude of scour is complicated by the cyclic nature of some scour
        processes and the fact that scour may occur naturally in rivers without any influence of
        bridges. Scour can be deepest near the peak of a flood, but hardly visible as floodwaters
        recede when scour holes may be refilled with sediment. </para>
      <para>The equations for estimating scour are based on laboratory experiments with limited
        field verification and these have been developed to assess scour at bridges under field
        conditions. </para>
      <para>Total scour at a bridge crossing considers three primary components: </para>

      <para>Streams are dynamic and will naturally change over time and during flood events. It is
        expected that river channels may migrate, especially at bends in the river, and degrade or
        aggrade over time. However a bridge crossing a water course is static so any natural changes
        in the river channel or bed can potentially affect the bridge.</para>
      <para>Scour at bridges includes contraction and local scour, both of which need to be
        considered in bridge design.</para>
      <para>Contraction scour is caused by a constriction in the floodplain either by a bridge or
        when overbank flow is confined by road embankments. A decrease in flow area results in an
        increase in average velocity and bed shear stress. Contraction scour is different from
        long-term degradation in that contraction scour occurs in the vicinity of the constriction
        (bridge), it may be intermittent, and/or related to the passing of a particular flood event. </para>
      <para>Contraction scour at a bridge is illustrated in Figure 25.</para>

      <para>Contraction scour also occurs in the vertical where flow is contracted vertically as

      <title>Design for scour at bridges</title>
      <para>The best scour protection measure is to minimise the risk of scour in the bridge
        design.</para>
      <para>Hydraulic modelling of a bridge site is an integral part of any bridge design and these
        studies should address the sizing of the bridge waterway helping to ensure that the
        foundations can be designed to minimise scour.</para>
      <para>It must be recognized that damage to bridge approaches from rare floods can be repaired
        relatively quickly to restore traffic service. On the other hand, a bridge which collapses
        or suffers major structural damage from scour can create safety hazards as well as
        significant social impacts and economic losses for a prolonged period of time. Therefore,
        scour resistant bridge foundations should be designed to a higher hydraulic standard. These
        concepts must be reflected in bridge design procedures. </para>
      <para>There are many methods for estimating scour as part of bridge design and these include
        equations by Holmes, Neill, Faraday and Charlton, Melville and Coleman, the CSU equation,
        FHWA HEC-18 equation, Froehlich equations and HIRE equations, with details for all provided
        in DTMR (2013).</para>
      <para>Encroachment in the stream channel by abutments and piers reduces the channel section
        and may cause significant contraction scour. Severe constriction of floodplain flow may
        cause approach embankment failures and serious contraction scour in the bridge waterway,
        where auxiliary (relief) openings can be considered but must be carefully designed. On wide
        floodplains the design should seek to avoid excessive diversion of floodplain flows towards
        the main bridge opening and skewed crossings of floodplains should also be minimised as much
        as possible. </para>
      <para>The increase in the velocity through the bridge waterway opening occurs as a result of
        the increase in the energy head. The restriction in the waterway results in water banking
        upstream to a level sufficient to develop the additional head to increase the velocity to

        embankment in the approaches to the bridge causes a restriction on the flow occurring under
        natural conditions. Consideration of the increase in velocity and hence scour potential and
        afflux would be the main determining factors for the length of a bridge. Longer bridges

      <title>Countermeasures for existing scour susceptible bridges</title>
      <para>The greatest damage to bridges during floods is normally observed between the bridge
        approach and the abutment. Historically, this is the intersection between the road and
        bridge designer’s responsibility. Protection of the bridge should consider the impacts of
        overtopping flows at the roadway. </para>
      <para>Scour countermeasures are incorporated at a bridge site to monitor, control, inhibit or

        is appropriate design that avoids causing stream instability but scour protection is needed
        for existing bridges that have experienced scour problems. </para>
      <para>Over the last several decades, a wide variety of countermeasure structures, armouring
        materials and monitoring devices have been used at existing bridges to mitigate scour and

      <para>Since scour susceptible bridges are already in place, options for structural or physical
        modifications such as replacement or foundation strengthening are limited and expensive.
        Unless these bridges are programmed for replacement, their continued operation will
        ultimately require the design and installation of a scour countermeasure. </para>
      <para>Riprap is one of the primary scour countermeasures to resist local scour forces at

        grading and placement methods are included in DTMR (2013). When designing riprap
        countermeasures, maintaining an adequate hydraulic opening through the bridge must be
        considered. Improperly placed riprap may reduce the hydraulic opening significantly and
        create contraction scour problems. If placed improperly, riprap can increase local scour
        forces. Although riprap is widely used, the following countermeasures can be considered as

      <title>Scour protection for culverts</title>
      <para>Culverts concentrate flow and also allow an increase in flood level upstream of the

        natural velocity in the channel. If this increase produces a velocity where scour could be
        introduced, protection measures are required, though good practice would lead to a design

    <title>Rock Chutes for Bed Protection</title>

    <section xml:id="b6_ch3_s_0atr7">
      <title>Introduction</title>
      <para>The stability of rivers and channels is often linked to the stability of the channel
        bed. Channels may be de-stabilised by (for example) the draining of a downstream swamp,
        which can initiate an erosion head that, unchecked, will migrate upstream with substantial
        subsequent bank collapse. </para>
      <para>A rock chute is a relatively short and steep section of the bed of a channel which has
        been armoured with rock. It is normally intended to either stabilize an erosion head,
        preventing it from moving upstream in the channel, or to reduce the overall grade of a
        channel by providing a weir within the channel bed. </para>
      <para>Although the concept of a rock chute is simple, proper hydraulic design is very
        important to ensure that the chute geometry and rock size are matched with the expected flow
        conditions such that the rock remains stable under all expected flow conditions. In
        addition, appropriate rock chute design requires that the abutments are treated to prevent
        failure by outflanking of the crest and that the grading of rock sizes within the rock
        mixture minimizes the presence of voids. </para>
      <para>This section summarises the theory for the proper hydraulic design of rock chutes and
        introduces a spreadsheet-based computer program, CHUTE, to design and analyse the
        performance of a chute under a range of flow conditions. This program has been developed as
        part of the CRC for Catchment Hydrology toolkit program. (http://www.toolkit.net.au/) </para>
      <para>In the following section, the essential elements for the hydraulic design of a rock
        chute are discussed. The design theory is then summarised and the spreadsheet-based design
        program described. In the final two sections, elements for good design practice are
        identified and final conclusions drawn. </para>

      <title>Hydraulic Design Elements</title>
      <para>A typical rock chute is shown schematically in Figure 29, together with an illustration
        of the various terms used in describing and designing a rock chute. From a hydraulic point
        of view, the primary elements are the chute face and the apron, since these provide
        protection to the bed from the erosive forces of the water. </para>
      <para>The primary design output is the rock size required to ensure a stable structure.
        Because the rock size is dependent on the bed shear stress, which, in turn, is dependent on
        the flow profile over the chute, a key element in the design process is the determination of
        the water surface profile </para>
      <para>Figure 30 shows, schematically, the three types of profile that may occur. </para>
      <para>It will be shown in the following section that the location of the point of maximum bed
        shear stress coincides with the location of the minimum depth. Clearly this location is
        dependent on the type of profile over the chute. </para>
      <para>The profile shown in Figure 30(c) is most likely to be associated with the maximum
        design flow in the river. With lower controlling tail water levels, the profiles shown in
        Figures 30(a) and 30(b) are associated with flow rates less than the maximum. Because of the
        lower minimum depths associated with the latter profiles, it is likely that the bed shear
        stresses will be larger with a consequent increase in the rock size required for stability </para>

      <para>This discussion demonstrates that the chute design flow rate – that for which the
        required rock size is a maximum – will be lower than the channel design flow rate - that for
        which the required channel capacity is a maximum. This is a most important distinction in
        the design of a rock chute and receives further comment later in this section. </para>

      <para>The magnitude of the constant is the subject of some difference of opinion in the

      <para>A chute may have bed slopes up to 20%, so the flat-bed assumption in the development of

      <para>Equation (8.4) demonstrates that, for a given flow rate per unit width, particle density,
        and Manning’s roughness parameter, the minimum rock size required for stability is strongly
        inversely proportional to the local depth, <emphasis role="italic">y</emphasis>. </para>
      <para>Solution of Equation (8.4) requires the determination of the water surface profile
        throughout the chute for a given flow rate and the consequent determination of the minimum
        value of depth. The normal design situation is shown in Figure 31 and corresponds to the
        case shown in Figure 30(a). </para>

      <para>For the case shown in Figure 31, two depths control the combined flow profile – critical
        depth at the chute crest and a known downstream subcritical depth. The downstream depth is
        dependent on controls further downstream and would normally be established from a
        one-dimensional program such as HEC-RAS (US Army Corps of Engineers 2002). </para>
      <para>The S2 profile downstream of the chute crest and the A1 or M1 profile over and upstream
        of the chute apron are computed using the standard step method, described in (eg) (Henderson
        1966). The location of the hydraulic jump is then determined as the point where the upstream
        and downstream depths form a conjugate pair – ie the Momentum Function is the same. </para>
      <para>For the case shown in Figure 30(c), the subcritical profile, controlled by the
        downstream depth, is everywhere higher than the conjugate profile, computed from the assumed
        upstream supercritical profile. In this case, the chute is said to be drowned. </para>
      <para>Although the computational details are standard, it needs to be recognised that the
        computed profiles are dependent on Manning’s roughness coefficient, which, in turn, is
        linked to the unknown rock size through the Strickler Equation (Henderson 1966): </para>

      <para>One important design input parameter is the factor of safety. Issues which govern the
        choice of value include the consequences of failure, the reliability of the input
        parameters, the quality and consistency of the available rock, and the likelihood of
        eventual stabilisation by vegetation. </para>
      <para>As a guide, values above 1.3 are appropriate where there are grave consequences of
        failure to property or assets. Values between 1.0 and 1.3 are applicable where the objective
        is general erosion control, where the risk of catastrophic failure is small, and where
        vegetation will eventually enhance the stability of the chute. </para>
      <para>There are a number of other important details in the design of rock chutes. These
        include the specification of rock quality, grading, and thickness; details of filters and
        cutoff walls; and the treatment of abutments to prevent outflanking. </para>
      <para>Rock quality, grading, and thickness issues; and the design of filters, are the same as
        those for riprap design (Hemphill and Bramley 1989). Cutoff walls are essential to minimise
        the risk of piping failures beneath the chute or through the abutments. Their importance
        increases with the permeability of the parent material, decreasing cohesion of the parent
        material, and the height and steepness of the chute. Abutments must be keyed into the banks
        of the channel. Rock riprap protection should be placed upstream and downstream of the chute
        to provide direct abutment protection. </para>

    <title>Rock Riprap</title>

      <title>Introduction</title>

      <para>Rip-rap is the term given to loose rock armour, usually obtained
      by quarrying. It is widely used for bank protection. Useful engineering
      qualities of rip-rap include:</para>

          <para>Durability</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      <para>Rip-rap is normally placed by machine in the dry, although it can be tidied or even
        placed by hand, to improve its packing density or to key larger stones into the underlayer
        or subsoil. As with granular underlayers, rip-rap can become segregated into different sized
        zones if dumped into place. The aim of machine placing is always to release the material as
        close as possible to its final position. Later spreading, by bulldozer or otherwise, may
        increase breakage, segregation, and surface roughness. </para>
      <para>A major advantage of rip-rap protection is that it is very flexible. As a result, damage
        tends to occur gradually and, as stones move relative to each other, is, to some extent,
        self-healing. This allows maintenance work to be undertaken on a routine basis – in contrast
        to rigid protection systems, such as concrete blocks, which require immediate repairs to
        prevent widespread progressive failure once localised failure occurs. It is, nevertheless,
        important that maintenance is carried out, since the misaligned surface where stones have
        been lost or where deformation has occurred will generally experience higher than average
        hydrodynamic forces. </para>
      <para>Although the concept of rock rip-rap is simple, proper hydraulic design is very
        important to ensure that the river geometry and rock size are matched with the expected flow
        conditions such that the rock remains stable under all expected flow conditions. In
        addition, appropriate rip-rap design requires that a number of other issues are adequately
        addressed. In particular: </para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>The grading of sizes within the rock rip-rap minimises the

        <para>The design procedure is essentially a development and simplification of the group of

          method developed by Simons and co-workers and documented by (Simons and Senturk, 1977). </para>
        <para>The theory is based on a fundamental force balance, requiring that, at the point of
          incipient particle motion, the disturbing forces on the particle (drag force exerted by
          the flow and weight component resolved down the slope) are balanced by the restoring
          forces (the product of the weight component resolved perpendicular to the bank and the tan
          of the natural angle of repose of the rip-rap material). </para>

        <title>Length of bank to be protected</title>
        <para>A site inspection and an understanding of the mechanisms causing erosion will assist
          in determining the appropriate length of bank to be treated. Aerial photographs will
          provide guidance in understanding the temporal development of the river alignment and,
          together with local knowledge, will often assist in determining the history of erosion at
          the site. Such a history is often a valuable indicator of likely future developments. </para>
        <para>Flow lines and corresponding points of attack will vary significantly with the flow
          level. In a meandering stream, the main current lines tend to straighten, and the point of
          attack on a bend will tend to move downstream, with increasing flow. </para>
        <para>Braided streams are less predictable. </para>
        <para>Erosion on the outside of bends will also move downstream with time. For this reason,
          it is desirable to continue erosion protection downstream beyond the limit of existing
          erosion. Generous location of the downstream limit is essential to successful rip-rap
          protection. As a guide for the treatment of major meander developments, riprap protection
          should be provided for a distance of twice the bank-to-bank distance downstream of the
          existing erosion. </para>
        <para>The upstream limit of erosion protection is generally easier to locate. As a guide for
          the treatment of major meander developments, rip-rap protection should be provided for a
          distance upstream of the existing erosion equal to the bank-to-bank distance. </para>

      <section xml:id="b6_ch3_s_uchbv">
        <title>Proportion of bank height to be protected</title>
        <para>It is generally not necessary to extend rip-rap protection to the top of the bank
          unless dictated by unusual site constraints. Such constraints may include the presence of
          strong overbank flows, upper bank erosion by strong wave action or prolonged high flows,
          and severe consequences of rip-rap failure. </para>
        <para>As a general rule, protection of the lower two thirds of a bank is usually considered
          to offer optimum protection. The upper one third of the bank can be treated, as
          appropriate, with less resistant and less expensive techniques such as vegetation. </para>
        <para>However, this rule should always be reviewed in the light of local knowledge and
          conditions. For example, conditions where a river has a very high bank such that bank-full
          flows are reached less than once a year, may justify a reduction in the height of
          protection. Conversely, a low bank, relative to the level of the annual flood, may need
          full protection. </para>
        <para>An understanding of the mode of failure also assists in this assessment. For example,
          if the bank failure mechanism is through undermining of the toe and subsequent collapse,
          protection of the toe is crucial. On the other hand, if fretting at high levels is
          primarily responsible for erosion, it is more important to provide protection at that
          water level. </para>
        <para>In designing extensive rip-rap works, it may be desirable to consider, in addition,
          the stream longitudinal profile. This gives the designer the additional options of
          ensuring that the height of rip-rap protection represents an adequate proportion of the
          average bank height, or allowing the rip-rap height to vary along the reach to reflect
          variations in the water surface profile. </para>

        <title>Allowance for scour at toe of rip-rap</title>

        <para>Many failures of rip-rap occur through undermining of the toe of
        the rip-rap by scour of the stream bed during high flow events. Two
        methods of allowing for this, illustrated in <xref linkend="b6_ch3_f_me94m"/>, are:</para>

          </listitem>
        </orderedlist>
        <para>Use of the second alternative requires care. The response of the rip-rap to settling
          is unpredictable. In particular, if a graded rock is used – as is recommended – the finer
          material will be susceptible to loss during settlement. Accordingly, it is recommended
          that allowance should be made for at least 50% loss of rock. </para>
        <para>In a particular design situation, the likely severity of bed scour needs to be
          assessed. Although this assessment should be technically based on techniques for
          estimating scour depth, the particular design situation is also of great importance. The
          following comments are pertinent: </para>

            <para>In meandering gravel bed rivers, allowance for scour on the

            to be reasonably small.</para>

        <title>Specification for rock quality and grading and thickness of
        layer</title>

        <para>Rock should be hard, tough, and durable. It should have a
        crushing strength of at least 25MPa. The rock should be free of
        defined cleavage planes and should not be adversely affected by
        repeated wetting and drying.</para>

        <para>The rock should be predominantly angular in shape with not more
        than 25% of rocks, distributed through the gradation, having a length
        more than twice the breadth or thickness. No rock should have a length
        exceeding 2.5 times its breadth or thickness.</para>

        <para>Where rock fails to meet this specification, it may still be
        considered at the designers discretion, provided allowance is made in
        the design for its shortcomings.</para>

        <para>Rock to meet the necessary size and strength criteria will
        normally be won from a hard rock quarry by drilling and blasting. A
        hydraulic rock breaker mounted on a hydraulic excavator provides an
        excellent means of producing rock to design size
        specifications.</para>

        <para>Rock should not be single sized, but, instead, should be a
        well-graded mixture designed to ensure that all interstices between
        large rocks are filled with rock of progressively smaller size. This
        has the effect of ensuring that no significant voids occur in the rock
        blanket through which underlying material can be washed out.
        Additionally, it helps to create an interlocking mass of rock which is
        highly stable.</para>

        <para>The thickness of rock rip-rap protection should be at least
        twice the median rip-rap diameter or equal to the largest rocks in the
        rip-rap mixture, whichever is the greater.</para>

        <para>Filter materials may be necessary to stabilise rip-rap protection over fine material.
        The filter layer prevents bed material being washed through residual interstices in the rock
        layer. Normally, a filter layer is only necessary where the underlying material is largely
        non-cohesive such as uniform sand or silt, high groundwater levels create large pore
        pressures, or an unusually high factor of safety is required. If one or more of these

      <title>Introduction</title>

      <para>Sharp-crested weirs are often used to measure flow in open
      channels. Among their advantages, are that they are easy to install,
      accurate, and relatively inexpensive.</para>

      <para>They do, however, have a major disadvantage in flows containing
      substantial amounts of sediment, in that they trap sediment and other
      solids behind them, leading to putrescible deposits in sewer
      applications. For this reason, sharp-crested weirs are most commonly
      used with relatively clean effluent, or in temporary flow monitoring
      locations.</para>

      <para>The emphasis in this sub-section is on the analytical techniques,
      weir properties, and choice for particular purposes, and submergence
      characteristics. In particular, complete details on variations in
      discharge coefficient are not given, and the reader is referred to
      specialist texts for such information.</para>

    <section xml:id="b6_ch3_s_r7m6e">
      <title>Rectangular Sharp-Crested Weir</title>

      <para>The analysis of the sharp-crested weir is best illustrated by
      reference to a weir comprising a vertical plate mounted at right-angles
      to the flow. This represents the so-called “rectangular sharp-crested
      weir”.</para>

      <para>The flow over such a weir is illustrated schematically in <xref linkend="b6_ch3_f_i7egf"/>. This figure includes also the necessary
      nomenclature for the analysis. Before proceeding with the analysis, some
      comments are provided on the flow situation.</para>

      </figure>

      <para>It is noted first that the pressure distribution at the weir crest
      is non-hydrostatic. This situation arises because the pressure at both
      Points A and B is atmospheric by definition, and there are significant
      vertical components in the velocity as the flow contracts to pass over
      the weir crest.</para>

      <para>Secondly, it is noted that, as expected, the total energy line
      (TEL) is situated an elevation <inlineequation>

      magnitude of the approach velocity head may be considered to be
      negligible. For simplicity, this is assumed in the following analysis,
      although the influence of the approach velocity head will be included
      later.</para>

      <para>Two further assumptions are utilised for simplicity:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>The flow does not contract as it passes over the weir – i.e.
          the elevation of A is the same as that of the upstream water
          surface.</para>

          <para>The pressure is atmospheric across the whole section
          AB.</para>

      </orderedlist>

      <para>With reference to<xref linkend="b6_ch3_f_i7egf"/>, these
      assumptions lead to an expression for the velocity at C of:</para>

      <title>Broad-crested Weirs and Long-Throated Flumes</title>

      <para>Because critical flow represents a unique relationship between
      depth and flow rate, devices which induce critical flow are often used
      to measure flow in open channels. Most of these devices, however,
      require calibration in the laboratory because the flow characteristics
      are not in accordance with the usual theoretical assumptions.</para>

      <para>Chief among these is the assumption that the pressure distribution
      is hydrostatic. In many devices, the strongly curved stream lines negate
      this assumption, resulting in the necessity for empirical
      coefficients.</para>

      <para>The broad-crested weir and the long-throated flume are devices for
      which the flow rate can be predicted theoretically without the need for
      such coefficients. The broadness of the crest and the length of the
      throat are such that the stream lines are close to horizontal in the
      region of critical flow, permitting the assumption that the pressure
      distribution is hydrostatic.</para>

      <para>The analysis of both the broad-crested weir and the long-throated
      flume is identical in that both rely on the determination of the
      relationship between the upstream water level (which may be measured)
      and critical depth within the constricted section – which is a known
      function of the flow rate. Thus, a unique relationship between flow rate
      and the upstream water surface elevation can be determined.</para>

      <para>Broad-crested weirs are more prone to sediment buildup than
      long-throated flumes and are, consequently, less common in sewerage
      systems. For this reason, the emphasis in the following is on
      long-throated flumes, while recognising that broad-crested weirs are
      analysed in the same manner.</para>

      <para>The long-throated flume is widely used in sewerage systems, within
      the pipe system and to monitor open channel inflows and outflows at
      sewage treatment plants.</para>

      <para>In this section, the advantages of this type of structure are
      first discussed. The derivation of the theoretical rating curve is then
      presented for the rectangular flume and it is shown how this can be
      generalised for arbitrary cross-section shape. Their use in practice is
      then illustrated.</para>

      <para>The primary advantages of these devices are listed in the

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Provided that critical flow occurs in the throat, a rating
          table can be calculated with an error of less than 2% in the listed
          discharge. This can be done for any combination of a prismatic
          throat and an arbitrarily-shaped approach channel.</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>The throat, perpendicular to the direction of flow, can be
          shaped in such a way that the complete range of discharges can be
          measured accurately, without creating an excessive backwater
          effect.</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>The head loss across the structure required to obtain
          undrowned flow conditions is minimal, and can be estimated with
          sufficient accuracy for any of the structures placed in any
          arbitrary channel.</para>

        <listitem>
          <para>Field and laboratory observations indicate that the structures
          can be designed to pass sediment transported by channels with
          subcritical flow. It should be noted, however, that excessively high
          sediment loads or significant reductions in the velocity of the
          approach flow may create sedimentation problems.</para>

      <title>Disadvantages</title>

      <para>The major property of a long-throated flume is that it is designed
      to create a constriction in the flow area sufficient to produce critical
      flow over the full range of expected flow rates. In addition, the head
      loss across the structure should not be excessive and afflux should be
      kept to a minimum.</para>

      <para>A typical long-throated flume is shown schematically in <emphasis role="bold"><xref linkend="b6_ch3_f_zo82l"/></emphasis>. With regard to
      the hydraulic characteristics of the flume itself, five components may
      be recognised as follows:</para>

      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>The approach channel, where the flow should be stable so that
          the water level and the energy level can be accurately
          determined.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>A converging transition region into the throat, which is
          designed to provide a smooth acceleration of the flow with no
          discontinuities or flow separation. The transition may be rounded or
          consist of plane surfaces.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The throat, where the flow is accelerated to the critical
          condition. The throat must be horizontal in the flow direction, but
          can, in principle, be of any shape transverse to the flow. The
          invert of the throat may be higher than the invert of the upstream
          and downstream channels.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>A diverging transition to reduce the flow velocity to an
          acceptable level and to recover head. If there is ample available
          head, an abrupt transition may be used.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The tailwater channel in which a known hydraulic control is
          exercised by the downstream conditions and the hydraulic properties
          of the channel.</para>

      <title>Uncertainty in Flow Measurement Structures</title>

      <para>No measurement is perfectly accurate or exact. Many instrumental,
      physical and human limitations cause measurements to deviate from the
      "true" values of the quantities being measured. We refer to these
      deviations as "uncertainties," although, more commonly, the shorter word
      "error" is used. In this review we will continue to use the word
      "uncertainty” since it is a more accurate descriptor</para>

      <section xml:id="b6_ch3_s_t94wf">
        <title>Systematic and Random Uncertainty</title>

        <para>Generally, uncertainties can be divided into two broad and rough
        but useful classes: systematic (or determinate) and random (or
        indeterminate).</para>

        <para>Systematic uncertainties tend to shift all measurements in a
        systematic way so their mean value is displaced. "Systematic" means
        that when the measurement of a quantity is repeated several times, the
        uncertainty has the same size and algebraic sign for every
        measurement.</para>

        <para>Systematic uncertainties may be due to such things as incorrect
        calibration of an instrument, consistently improper use of equipment
        or failure to properly account for some effect. A systematic
        uncertainty is a true error and large systematic errors can and must
        be eliminated in a good experiment. Every effort should be made to
        minimize the possibility of these errors, by careful calibration of
        the apparatus and by use of the best possible measurement techniques.
        However, small systematic errors will always be present. For instance,
        no instrument can ever be calibrated perfectly.</para>

        <para>Other sources of systematic errors are external effects which
        can change the results of the experiment, but for which the
        corrections are not well known.</para>

        <para>Systematic errors can be more serious than random uncertainties
        for three reasons as follows:</para>

        <orderedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>There is no sure method for discovering and identifying them
            just by looking at the experimental data.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>Their effects cannot be reduced by averaging repeated
            measurements.</para>
          </listitem>

          <listitem>
            <para>A systematic error has the same size and sign for each
            measurement in a set of repeated measurements, so there is no
            opportunity for positive and negative errors to offset each
            other.</para>
          </listitem>
        </orderedlist>

        <para>Random uncertainties fluctuate from one measurement to the next
        and are present in all experimental measurements. As such, they cause
        a measuring process to give different values when a measurement is
        repeated many times (assuming all other conditions are held constant
        to the best of the operator’s ability). Random uncertainties can have
        many causes, including operator errors or biases, fluctuating physical
        conditions, varying environmental conditions and inherent variability
        of measuring instruments.</para>

        <para>The effect that random uncertainties have on results can be
        somewhat reduced by taking repeated measurements then calculating
        their average. The average is generally considered to be a "better"
        representation of the "true value" than any single measurement,
        because uncertainties of positive and negative sign tend to compensate
        each other in the averaging process. They yield results distributed

        <para>A measurement with relatively small random uncertainty is said
        to have high precision. A measurement with small random uncertainty
        and small systematic error is said to have high accuracy. Precision
        does not necessarily imply accuracy. A precise measurement may be
        inaccurate if it has a systematic error.</para>

        <title>Determination of Flow Rate Uncertainty from Uncertainty in
        Measured Head</title>

        <para>Frequently, the assessed flow rate will not be measured
        directly. Rather, it will be determined through a functional
        relationship from a measurement of head with its own uncertainty. The
        question is: What is the resulting uncertainty in the assessed flow
        rate?</para>

        <para>The answer depends on the equation linking the flow rate with
        the directly measured parameters. We first return to the functional
        relationship derived for the rectangular sharp-crested weir:</para>
