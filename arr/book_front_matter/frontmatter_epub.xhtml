      <h2>PREFACE</h2> Since its first publication in 1958, Australian Rainfall and Runoff (ARR) has
      remained one of the most influential and widely used guidelines published by Engineers
      Australia (EA). The 3rd edition, published in 1987, retained the same level of national and
      international acclaim as its predecessors. <p>With nationwide applicability, balancing the
        varied climates of Australia, the information and the approaches presented in Australian
        Rainfall and Runoff are essential for policy decisions and projects involving:</p><ul>
        <li>infrastructure such as roads, rail, airports, bridges, dams, stormwater and sewer
          systems;</li>
        <li>town planning;</li>
        <li>mining;</li>
        <li>developing flood management plans for urban and rural communities;</li>
        <li>flood warnings and flood emergency management;</li>
        <li>operation of regulated river systems; and</li>
        <li>prediction of extreme flood levels.</li>
      </ul><p>However, many of the practices recommended in the 1987 edition of ARR have become
        outdated, and no longer represent the accepted views of professionals, both in terms of
        technique and approach to water management. This fact, coupled with greater understanding of
        climate and climatic influences makes the securing of current and complete rainfall and
        streamflow data and expansion of focus from flood events to the full spectrum of flows and
        rainfall events, crucial to maintaining an adequate knowledge of the processes that govern
        Australian rainfall and streamflow in the broadest sense, allowing better management, policy
        and planning decisions to be made.</p><p>One of the major responsibilities of the National
        Committee on Water Engineering of Engineers Australia is the periodic revision of ARR. While
        the NCWE had long identified the need to update ARR it had become apparent by 2002 that even
        with a piecemeal approach the task could not be carried out without significant financial
        support. In 2008 the revision of ARR was identified as a priority in the Council of
        Australian Governments endorsed National Adaptation Framework for Climate Change.</p><p>In
        addition to the update 21 projects were identified with the aim of filling knowledge gaps.
        Funding for Stages 1 and 2 of the ARR revision projects were provided by the now Department
        of the Environment. Stage 3 was funded by Geoscience Australia. Funding for Stages 2 and 3
        of Project 1 (Development of Intensity-Frequency-Duration information across Australia) has
        been provided by the Bureau of Meteorology. The outcomes of the projects assisted the ARR
        Editorial Team with the compiling and writing of chapters in the revised ARR. Steering and
        Technical Committees were established to assist the ARR Editorial Team in guiding the
        projects to achieve desired outcomes.</p><table class="blank_table">

      <h2>Status of this document</h2><p>This document is a living document and will be regularly
        updated in the future.</p><p>In development of this guidance, also discussed in Book 1 of
        ARR 1987, it was recognised that knowledge and information availability is not fixed and
        that future research and applications will develop new techniques and information. This is
        particularly relevant in applications where techniques have been extrapolated from the
        region of their development to other regions and where efforts should be made to reduce
        large uncertainties in current estimates of design flood characteristics. </p><p>Therefore,
        where circumstances warrant, designers have a duty to use other procedures and design
        information more appropriate for their design flood problem. The Editorial team of this
        edition of Australian Rainfall and Runoff believe that the use of new or improved procedures
        should be encouraged, especially where these are more appropriate than the methods described
        in this publication. </p>Care should be taken when combining inputs derived using ARR 1987
      and methods described in this document. <h3>What is new in ARR 2019?</h3><p>Geoscience
        Australia, on behalf of the Australian Government, asked the National Committee on Water
        Engineers (NCWE) - a specialist committee of Engineers Australia - to continue overseeing
        the technical direction of ARR. ARR's success comes from practitioners and researchers
        driving its development; and the NCWE is the appropriate organisation to oversee this work.
        The NCWE has formed a sub-committee to lead the ongoing management and development of ARR
        for the benefit of the Australian community and the profession. The current membership of
        the ARR management subcommittee includes Mark Babister, Robin Connolly, Rory Nathan and Bill
        Weeks. </p><p>The ARR team have been working hard on finalising ARR since it was released in
        2016. The team has received a lot of feedback from industry and practitioners, ranging from
        substantial feedback to minor typographical errors. Much of this feedback has now been
        addressed. Where a decision has been made not to address the feedback, advice has been
        provided as to why this was the case. </p><p>A new version of ARR is now available. ARR 2019
        is a result of extensive consultation and feedback from practitioners. Noteworthy updates
        include the completion of Book 9, reflection of current climate change practice and
        improvements to user experience, including the availability of the document as a PDF.
