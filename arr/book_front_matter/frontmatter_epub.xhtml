      <h2>PREFACE</h2>
      
      <p>Since its first publication in 1958, Australian Rainfall and Runoff (ARR) has remained 
        one of the most influential and widely used guidelines published by Engineers Australia 
        (EA). The 3rd edition, published in 1987, retained the same level of national and 
        international acclaim as its predecessors.</p> 
      
      <p>With nationwide applicability, balancing the varied climates of Australia, the 
        information and the approaches presented in Australian Rainfall and Runoff are 
        essential for policy decisions and projects involving:</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li>infrastructure such as roads, rail, airports, bridges, dams, stormwater and sewer systems;</li>
        <li>town planning;</li>
        <li>mining;</li>
        <li>developing flood management plans for urban and rural communities;</li>
        <li>flood warnings and flood emergency management;</li>
        <li>operation of regulated river systems; and</li>
        <li>prediction of extreme flood levels.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>However, many of the practices recommended in the 1987 edition of ARR have become 
        outdated, and no longer represent industry best practice. This fact, coupled with 
        the greater understanding of climate and flood hydrology derived from the larger 
        data sets now available to us, has provided the primary impetus for revising these 
        guidelines. It is hoped that this revision will lead to improved design practice, 
        which will allow better management, policy and planning decisions to be made.</p>
      
      <p>One of the major responsibilities of the National Committee on Water Engineering 
        of Engineers Australia is the periodic revision of ARR. While the NCWE had long 
        identified the need to update ARR it had become apparent by 2002 that even with 
        a piecemeal approach the task could not be carried out without significant financial 
        support. In 2008 the revision of ARR was identified as a priority in the National 
        Adaptation Framework for Climate Change which was endorsed by the Council of 
        Australian Governments.</p>
      
      <p>In addition to the update, 21 projects were identified with the aim of filling 
        knowledge gaps. Funding for Stages 1 and 2 of the ARR revision projects were 
        provided by the now Department of the Environment. Stage 3 was funded by Geoscience 
        Australia. Funding for Stages 2 and 3 of Project 1 
        (Development of Intensity-Frequency-Duration information across Australia) has been 
        provided by the Bureau of Meteorology. The outcomes of the projects assisted the 
        ARR Editorial Team with the compiling and writing of chapters in the revised ARR. 
        Steering and Technical Committees were established to assist the ARR Editorial Team 
        in guiding the projects to achieve desired outcomes.</p>

      <h2>Status of this document</h2>
      
      <p>This document is a living document and will be regularly
        updated in the future.</p>
      
      <p>In development of this guidance, and discussed in Book 1 of
        ARR 1987, it was recognised that knowledge and information availability is not fixed and
        that future research and applications will develop new techniques and information. This is
        particularly relevant in applications where techniques have been extrapolated from the
        region of their development to other regions and where efforts should be made to reduce
        large uncertainties in current estimates of design flood characteristics. </p>
      <p>Therefore,
        where circumstances warrant, designers have a duty to use other procedures and design
        information more appropriate for their design flood problem. The Editorial team of this
        edition of Australian Rainfall and Runoff believe that the use of new or improved procedures
        should be encouraged, especially where these are more appropriate than the methods described
        in this publication. </p>
      
      <p>Care should be taken when combining inputs derived using ARR 1987
      and methods described in this document.</p>
      
      <h2>Change Log</h2>
	  <h3>Version 4.2 - Climate Change Chapter Update</h3>
      <p>In late 2022 the Australian Government Department of Climate Change, Energy, the Environment 
	  and Water in partnership with Engineers Australia commenced an 18 month project to update the climate 
	  change considerations chapter of the Australian Rainfall and Runoff guidelines (Chapter 6, Book 1) to 
	  incorporate the most recent and relevant climate science and projections. The project involved the 
	  undertaking of a rigorous literature review of hydroclimatology under climate change relevant to design 
	  flood estimation, which was peer reviewed and published in a leading international journal. The findings 
	  were used to draft practical flood guidance which was finalised after an extensive process of review and 
	  feedback by industry. Funding for this project was received from National Emergency Management Agency under 
	  the Disaster Risk Reduction Package. The project report was adapted to replace Book 1 chapter 6.</p>

	  <h3>ARR 2019 (now Version 4.1)</h3>
	  <p>Geoscience Australia, on behalf of the Australian Government, asked the National Committee on Water Engineers (NCWE) - a specialist committee of Engineers Australia - to continue overseeing the technical direction of ARR. ARR's success comes from practitioners and researchers driving its development; and the NCWE is the appropriate organisation to oversee this work. The NCWE has formed a sub-committee to lead the ongoing management and development of ARR for the benefit of the Australian community and the profession. The current membership of the ARR management subcommittee includes Mark Babister, Robin Connolly, Rory Nathan and Bill Weeks.</p>
      <p>The ARR team have been working hard on finalising ARR since it was released in 2016. The team has received a lot of feedback from industry and practitioners, ranging from substantial feedback to minor typographical errors. Much of this feedback has now been addressed. Where a decision has been made not to address the feedback, advice has been provided as to why this was the case.</p>
	  <p>A new version of ARR is now available. ARR 2019
        is a result of extensive consultation and feedback from practitioners. Noteworthy updates
        include the completion of Book 9, reflection of current climate change practice and
        improvements to user experience, including the availability of the document as a PDF.
