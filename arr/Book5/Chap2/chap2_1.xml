  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>Within these sections the alternative types of direct runoff models
  will be discussed together with the need for models of baseflow and losses.
  Consequently, the differences between lumped and distributed models will be
  presented inclusive of the differing needs for calibration information and
  the information produced. The need for conceptualisation of the catchment
  storage will be introduced Also discussed will be the concept of catchment
  storage as a lead-in to the next chapter.</para>
