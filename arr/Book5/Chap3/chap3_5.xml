  <title>Kinematic, Diffusion, and Dynamic Wave Approaches </title>

  <para>In this section, the routing techniques based on the dynamic wave or
  simplifications of the dynamic wave will be discussed. The focus in this
  section will be on one-dimensional approaches (2d will be discussed in the
  next section). Included in the discussion will be the assumptions and
  conceptualisations that are needed for application of these approaches. It
  is suspected that this section may need to be split into three subsections
  when the text is completed.</para>
