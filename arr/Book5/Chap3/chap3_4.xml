  <title>Non-linear Reservoir Approaches</title>

  <para>Outlined in this section will be non-linear reservoir techniques that
  have been applied in Australia. The discussion will include the theory
  behind the model together with the implementation of that theory in
  different software packages; the purpose being not one of recommending those
  software packages but rather showing the alternative methods for
  implementing the approaches. Both urban and rural implementations will be
  considered. Hence a discussion of the inherent assumptions for the
  alternative situations will be necessary.</para>
