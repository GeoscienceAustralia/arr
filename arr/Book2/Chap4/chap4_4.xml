  <title>System (move?)</title>

  <para>Outlined in this section are the specific needs for design spatial
  patterns when a system, or network, of drainage links is being considered;
  in other words, how to consider the situation when the storm duration needs

  system. In particular, the spatial extent of particular burst durations
  needs to be considered.</para>
