  <title>Drainage System Hydraulics</title>

  <section>
    <title/>

    <para>Subsections have not been developed yet for this chapter. However,
    the intention is that aspects of drainage system hydraulics particular to
    urban drainage systems will be outlined. It is expected that these aspects
    will include aspects of closed conduit flow, development of surcharge
    flows (as opposed to development of pressurised flow), hydraulic
    structures such as pits, chambers, and overflows, etc.</para>
