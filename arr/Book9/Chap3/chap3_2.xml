  <title>Alternative Approaches </title>

  <para>Outlined in this section will be alternative approaches for estimation
  of surface runoff together with the advantages and disadvantages. Guidance
  on the selection of approaches will be provided. It is expected that the
  theoretical background for alternative approaches will not be replicated
  here (this theory should be presented earlier in Book 5) but rather the
  specific aspects relevant to urban drainage will be highlighted.</para>
