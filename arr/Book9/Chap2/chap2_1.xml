      <title>The Urban Hydrological Cycle</title>

      <para> Presented in this section of Australian Rainfall and Runoff are the changes to the hydrologic cycle and the impacts of these changes on prediction of design flood estimates. Important aspects to highlight are the non-uniform changes across probabilities, the change to soil moisture, the importation of water into urban environments and the export of water from urban environments through non-surface drainage systems. </para>
