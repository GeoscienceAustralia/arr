        <para>ensembling spatial patterns. For large studies and particularly
        large catchments it is important to understand the extent of spatial
        variability between events. Where topography is dominant or large
        events are generally produced by a single rainfall mechanism there is
        likely to be only moderate variability between events but for some
        catchments large events can have significantly different spatial
        variability. Spatially mapping rainfall depths for 5-10 largest events
        will generally provide a good understanding of variability and can be
        used for ensemble modelling. Such an approach will also confirm the
        suitability of the gridded IFD surface.</para>

      <listitem>
        <para>Where rain gauge networks are dense it is clear that there is
        significant spatial variability between events in some locations on
        even small catchments. In most locations there is insufficient data to
        locally characterise this variability. Where it is important to
        understand how spatial variability will affect performance or to
        analysis performance of the system and not just a single location it
        is possible to use spatial patterns and even spatial time slices in
        analysis. Where insufficient local data is available it is possible to
        use spatial patterns from the short duration ARF project in design.
        These patterns can be normalised by accounting for any IFD gradient
        and then orientated with local IFD gradient. Such approaches need
        careful application.</para>
