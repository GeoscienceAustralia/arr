    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>As discussed in <xref linkend="b2_ch2"/>, the description of rainfall events used in most
      currently applied design flood estimation methods is based on a reductionist approach, where
      the temporal and spatial variations of rainfall within an event are represented separately by
      typical temporal patterns and spatial patterns of event rainfall. </para>
    <para>This chapter provides practitioners with recommendations on the derivation and application
      of spatial patterns of rainfall for use in design flood estimation using representations of
      varying complexity. This includes recommendations for reconstructing the space-time patterns
      of rainfall for the observed events used in the calibration of hydrologic catchment
      models.</para>
    <para> There are a number of items where the authors recognise that the guidance adopted in this
      chapter is uncertain and where benefit would be obtained from further research to better
      quantify and potentially reduce the impact of those uncertainties on design flood estimation
      practice. Section 6 lists and briefly discusses the residual uncertainties relating to various
      aspects of the derivation and application of spatial and space-time patterns of rainfall, and
      recommends potential areas of future investigation.</para>

      <title>Precipitation Observation Methods and Uncertainties Associated with Reconstructing
        Space-Time Rainfall Patterns</title>
      <para>There is no accepted method for determining the space-time pattern of rainfall that is
        not influenced by the resolution and accuracy of networks of rainfall observations.</para>
      <para>Rainfall gauges provide data on the rainfall depths observed at the point location of
        the rainfall gauge over different periods of time. Daily reporting rainfall gauges provide
        rainfall depths recorded at the gauge over the preceding day period, with the Bureau of
        Meteorology’s typical practice being that these gauges report at 9:00 am local time on each
        day. Pluviograph or tipping bucket rainfall gauges can provide rainfall depths observed at a
        point location for sub-daily temporal resolution. They can provide rainfall depths with
        temporal resolutions down to less than one minute.</para>
      <para>Rainfall gauges are subject to some observational errors but they typically provide
        relatively accurate measurements of the time series of rainfall recorded at a point
        location. They can under-record rainfall during periods of high winds, particularly for snow
        or for when rainfall intensities are low. There can be errors associated with estimating
        rainfall rates from tipping bucket rainfall gauges over defined periods of time from the
        recorded times of the bucket tips. During periods of very high rainfall intensity, tipping
        bucket rainfall gauges can be subject to errors induced by the bucket failing to tip or
        tipping when it is partially full. Rainfall gauges can also be subject to errors in manual
        recording of the data or electronic transmission of data from telemetered rainfall
        sites.</para>
      <para>The chief uncertainty introduced by a network of rainfall gauges is in accurately
        observing the space-time pattern of rainfall across an area because they cannot observe
        variations in rainfall patterns between the gauges
          <citation>b2_c4_r31,b2_c4_r2,b2_c4_r5</citation>.</para>
      <para>Remote sensing approaches can provide estimates of rainfall intensity observed on a
        spatial grid across a wide observation domain for a given period of time. The two most
        commonly available remote sensing approaches for rainfall estimation are ground-based
        weather radar and satellite observing systems.</para>
      <para>Weather radars measure the reflectivity returned by rain drops, hail stones or snow,
        which are converted into a rainfall intensity estimate. There are several different types of
        errors in this process that degrade the accuracy of the radar rainfall measurement
          <citation>b2_c4_r20,b2_c4_r9</citation>. The analysis of radar data to derive space-time
        patterns requires specialist expertise that lies outside the scope of these guidelines.
        However, such analysis could be considered for large or high risk studies which are able to
        secure the specialist expertise required. Weather radar approaches typically provide
        estimates of rainfall intensities that are more accurate on a relative basis within the
        space-time field of the event than in absolute magnitude terms.</para>

      <title>Data Availability</title>
      <para>Rainfall gauge observations are available at many locations across Australia for very
        long time periods, with data available at some sites since the middle of the 19th century
        (refer to <xref linkend="b2_ch3"/>). By contrast, reliable archives of data from remote
        sensing (weather radar and satellite based instruments) are only available from about the
        mid 1990s. For many events, the only data that will be available to the practitioner to
        reconstruct the space-time pattern of rainfall will be from rainfall gauges.</para>
      <para>The practitioner should make use of the available data to reconstruct the space-time

      <title>Construction of Space-Time Patterns from Rainfall Gauge Networks</title>
      <para>When estimating the space-time pattern of rainfall from rainfall gauges there is an
        uncertainty introduced to the estimates in the interpolation of the unobserved rainfall at
        locations between the gauges (for example, <citation>b2_c4_r38+1</citation> and
          <citation>b2_c4_r3+1</citation>).</para>
      <para>The conventional approach applied in flood estimation for approximating the space-time
        pattern of rainfall from gauge networks has been:</para>
      <orderedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>To estimate the spatial pattern of rainfall for the whole rainfall event; and</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>To disaggregate the rainfall accumulation for each part of the spatial domain, often
            a model subarea or subcatchment, using the temporal pattern observed at a particular
            rainfall gauge.</para>
        </listitem>
      </orderedlist>
      <para>The conventional approach is a valid method in most situations but it may be that a more
        sophisticated approach involving construction of different spatial patterns for different
        increments of the event are required when spatial or temporal variability of the rainfall
        pattern for the event is large <citation>b2_c4_r37</citation>. Considerations for
        application of each of the two steps are discussed in <xref linkend="b2_ch4_s_9uuis"/> and
          <xref linkend="b2_ch4_s_0kk62"/>. Potential alternative approaches are discussed in <xref
          linkend="b2_ch4_s_kcr90"/>.</para>
      <section xml:id="b2_ch4_s_9uuis">
        <title>Construction of Spatial Patterns</title>
        <para>The spatial pattern should be constructed using rainfall totals from daily rainfall
          gauges and where available continuous rainfall gauges. Gauges should be obtained from both
          within the catchment or study area and for a region around the catchment. As an indicative
          value, the region used for constructing the spatial pattern should extend to include
          gauges that are within at least 10 km of the catchment or study area boundary or further
          if internal catchment gauges are further from the boundary.</para>
        <para>There is no preferred technique for constructing a spatial pattern of rainfall for an
          event. Hand drawing of rainfall contours informed by the rainfall totals at the gauges
          remains a valid approach that will produce acceptable results for many rainfall
          events.</para>
        <para>Spatial interpolation techniques using a computer usually involve interpolation
          between the point observations onto a grid, defined in either a geographic or projected
          Cartesian coordinate system. The grid resolution should be sufficiently fine to capture
          the spatial variability in the rainfall field at a meaningful scale for the catchment. It
          is recommended that the resolution of the grid should be 1 km (for a projected grid) or
          0.01° (for a geographic grid) or finer. There are many potential approaches that have been
          developed for spatial interpolation (<citation>b2_c4_r39+1</citation> and the references
          therein), including:</para>

          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>
        <para>Some Kriging and spline interpolation algorithms allow for the use of a covariate in
          the interpolation algorithm, which may improve the accuracy of the interpolation. Either
          elevation or design rainfall intensities for a relevant AEP and duration may provide
          appropriate covariates that improve the accuracy of the interpolation, particularly in
          catchments or study areas that are subject to appreciable and consistent orographic
          effects.</para>
        <para>Gridded daily rainfall data sets are available from SILO and the Australian Water
          Availability Project <citation>b2_c4_r15</citation>. These data sets may be useful for
          providing spatial patterns of rainfall events but they should be used with caution as they
          were not derived with the intention of being used for design flood estimation (refer to
            <xref linkend="b1_ch4_s_6l32u"/> and <xref linkend="b2_ch6_s_zjdnw"/>).</para>
        <para>Regardless of the approach that is used to produce the spatial pattern, the
          practitioner should check the spatial pattern produced by mapping it against the point
          values observed at rainfall gauges. If the mapping reveals anomalies in the interpolation
          approach, an alternative method should be adopted. Where large gaps in rainfall gauge
          coverage exist (particularly in mountainous areas) careful review of the simplifying
          assumptions made in the interpolation procedure should be undertaken by the practitioner
          to avoid unrealistic spatial patterns.</para>
        <para>Rainfall totals for each model subarea should be estimated from the spatially
          interpolated rainfall field for the event by averaging the rainfall totals at all grid
          cells that intersect with the spatial extent of the model subarea. Mathematically, this is
          represented by:</para>

        <para>Where data is available from more than one recording rainfall gauge, this provides
          options to the practitioner on which gauge to select to provide the temporal pattern for
          each subarea of the model. An assumption is often made that the most appropriate pattern
          would be provided by the recording rainfall gauge that is located closest, by horizontal
          distance, from the centroid of the model subarea. Whilst the closest gauge by physical
          distance makes intuitive sense, it is not necessarily the case that it must provide the
          most appropriate pattern for allocating the temporal pattern of a particular subarea. The
          practitioner may consult other information, such as catchment topography, data on wind
          velocities during the event or remote sensing data to guide the selection of an
          alternative to the nearest gauge for providing the temporal pattern. The practitioner may
          also use other information on the meteorology of the event to justify use of an adjusted
          temporal pattern for disaggregation. For example, if information was available that a
          particular rainfall event was moving in a particular direction at an average velocity of
          15 km/h and a model subarea was located 30 km downwind of a rainfall gauge, it may be
          justified to adjust the temporal pattern recorded at this gauge by moving it backward in
          time by two hours, to represent the estimated travel time of the storm from the rainfall
          gauge to the model subarea.</para>
        <para>The time series of rainfall at each recording gauge should be checked before it is
          used for disaggregation. The event total rainfall at each recording gauge should be
          checked, where available, against the event total rainfall at other daily recording and
          continuously rainfall gauges in the vicinity. A gauge should not be used if significant
          anomalies are identified in the recorded data for the site.</para>

        <title>Alternative Approaches to Construction of Space-Time Patterns </title>
        <para>A potential alternative approach to construct the space-time pattern of rainfall for
          an event from rainfall gauge data only is to construct a three dimensional space-time
          pattern grid. In this approach, the overall event spatial pattern would be interpolated
          onto a grid, using one of the potential approaches discussed in <xref
            linkend="b2_ch4_s_9uuis"/>. The total rainfall for each grid cell would then be
          disaggregated using the temporal pattern from an assigned rainfall gauge, using a similar
          method as discussed in <xref linkend="b2_ch4_s_0kk62"/>. For each time increment, a
          summation is formed for all of the grid cells that intersect spatially with each model
          subarea. Each subarea would then have its own, potentially unique, temporal pattern for
          the event.</para>
        <para>In a catchment that is well instrumented with rainfall gauges, it is possible to
          perform a spatial interpolation on to a grid for each time increment. The gridded rainfall
          for each time increment would then be summed to produce a temporal pattern for each model
          subarea. If this approach is used, the total rainfall across the event should be
          calculated for each subarea and then compared to the rainfall computed from spatially
          interpolating the event total rainfall only. Adjustments should be considered to the
          approach if the totals for any subarea differ by more than 5%.</para>

      <title>Space-Time Patterns for Calibration </title>
      <para>Simulation of historical flood events for calibration purposes includes reconstruction
        of the space-time pattern of rainfall over the catchment by the practitioner. The values of
        the apparent optimum set of model parameters for a given event can be influenced by the
        approach taken to estimate the space-time pattern of rainfall for the event. For example, if
        a catchment is simulated using an initial loss-continuing loss runoff generation model, then
        if all other parameters and inputs are the same a lower continuing loss rate is likely to be
        required to generate the same volume of runoff if a uniform spatial pattern is adopted
        compared with a non-uniform spatial pattern. The practitioner should consider and articulate
        the influence of assumptions made in deriving the space-time pattern of rainfall for the
        event on the values of the runoff-routing model parameters calibrated for the event.</para>
      <para>The spatial coverage of pluviographs around a catchment may be relatively sparse. This
        introduces uncertainty into the estimation of the actual temporal pattern of rainfall for
        any given subarea or grid cell of a model. Whilst a reasonable assumption may be that the
        temporal pattern for a given model subarea would be defined by the pluviograph that is
        nearest in horizontal distance, this may not necessarily produce the most accurate temporal
        pattern for the model subarea. As discussed in <xref linkend="b2_ch4_s_0kk62"/>, a more
        accurate representation of the space-time rainfall pattern over a model subarea may be
        produced by judicious adjustment of the temporal pattern observed at a gauge or selection of
        a temporal pattern from a gauge that is not physically closest to the subarea centroid.
        Adjusting the assignment of temporal patterns to subareas in this manner may assist the
        practitioner in achieving a more robust calibration of the model parameters to the event.
        Adjustment of temporal patterns and temporal pattern assignment is therefore allowable,
        particularly if meteorological evidence is provided to support the decision.</para>
      <para>The spatial or space-time pattern should be interpolated on to a regular grid that is
        constructed over the catchment. The resolution of the grid should be sufficiently fine to
        allow for spatial variations to be adequately represented. In most situations, the grid
        resolution should be selected so that there are at least 4 grid cells overlapping with the
        smallest subcatchment to be adopted in the model.</para>
      <para>Remote sensing data, where available, may be used to estimate the space-time rainfall
        field of an event for catchment modelling system calibration. If used, the space-time
        rainfall field should be corrected using data from rainfall gauges, using a recommended
        approach for adjusting for the mean field bias.</para>

      <para>As a minimum, it is recommended that a single non-uniform spatial pattern is applied to
        catchments with an area greater than 20 km<superscript>2</superscript>. The non-uniform
        spatial pattern should be derived with the aim of replicating the systematic variation in
        spatial variability that would be expected across the catchment during rainfall events of
        similar AEP to the design floods that are being estimated.</para>
      <para>For estimation of design flood events more frequent than and including the 1% AEP event,
        the spatial pattern should be estimated using the spatial pattern derived from the design
        rainfall grids (as discussed in <xref linkend="b2_ch3"/>) across the catchment for the
        relevant IFD surface for the AEP and duration. In many cases there will be little relative
        variation in spatial distribution between probabilities or adjacent duration. Different
        spatial patterns could be applied for different durations. Alternatively, one spatial
        pattern may be estimated for the critical duration and this single spatial pattern may then
        be applied for all durations.</para>
      <para>For estimation of design flood events rarer than 1% AEP with durations of 6 hours and
        less on catchment areas less than 1000 km<superscript>2</superscript>, the spatial pattern
        should be derived in accordance with <citation>b2_c6_r130+1</citation> for the relevant
        duration. Use of different spatial patterns for different AEP ranges may introduce
        inconsistencies at the adjacent limits of each method, and if this is the case then any such
        inconsistencies should be smoothed in an appropriate fashion.</para>
      <para>For estimation of design flood events rarer than 1% AEP with durations of 9 hours and
        greater or on catchment areas greater than 1000 km<superscript>2</superscript>, the spatial
        pattern should be derived from the Topographic AdjustmentFactor (TAF) database derived from
        the generalised PMP method that is relevant for zone that the catchment is located in. Use
        of different spatial patterns for different AEP ranges may introduce inconsistencies at the
        adjacent limits of each method, and if this is the case then any such inconsistencies should
        be smoothed in an appropriate fashion.</para>
      <para>For large studies and particularly for large catchments the practitioner should
        investigate and analyse the variability in spatial patterns between events. Where topography
        is dominant or large events are generally produced by a single rainfall mechanism there is
        likely to be only moderate variability between events but for some catchments there can be
        significant variations in space-time patterns between events. The practitioner should
        prepare and examine maps of the spatial pattern of rainfall for each event as a whole and
        for time slices, for example each 24 hour period,  using an approach described in <xref
          linkend="b2_ch4_s_v5tqp"/>. These spatial patterns should be compared to rainfall
        accumulations from Intensity Frequency Duration analysis for a relevant duration and AEP
        (refer to Jordan et al., 2015 for an example of this approach). Consistency in spatial
        patterns between events may reveal that it is acceptable to apply a single spatial pattern
        for all design flood estimates, particularly if it is consistent with the design rainfall
        analysis.</para>
      <para>As discussed in <xref linkend="b2_ch4_s_8o7l5"/>, partial area storms should always be
        explicitly considered for catchments with an area exceeding 30 000

      <title>Alternative Approach: Monte Carlo Sampling from Separate Populations of Spatial and

      <para>A more advanced approach that may be justified would be Monte Carlo simulation by
        sampling from a set of space-time rainfall patterns across the catchment of interest. There
        are two potential options that may be considered for implementing this approach: (1)
        sampling from separate populations of spatial and temporal patterns for the catchment; or
        (2) sampling from a single set of “linked” space-time patterns for the catchment.</para>
      <para>The first approach requires the assembly of:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>A set (or population) of spatial patterns across the catchment of interest from a
            number of observed rainfall events; and</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para>A set of temporal patterns from a number of observed rainfall events.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>The spatial pattern of rainfall should be assembled for each event in the population, in
        accordance with the methods discussed in <xref linkend="b2_ch4_s_v5tqp"/>. The catchment
        average rainfall accumulation should be computed for each event and continuously rainfall
        gauges located in or near the catchment should be used to estimate the duration over which
        most of the total rainfall accumulation was likely to have fallen in the catchment. The
        estimated catchment average depth for the event and the estimated rainfall event duration
        should be used with the table of design rainfall estimates for the catchment, after
        application of the applicable ARF, to estimate the AEP of the rainfall for each
        event.</para>
      <para>Similarly, the temporal pattern of rainfall should be assembled for each event in the
        population. The temporal pattern may be assembled at a single continuously rainfall gauge or
        from a combination of a number of continuously rainfall gauges located in the vicinity of
        the catchment or study area. The temporal pattern should be analysed to extract the maximum
        burst for a number of different durations. The rainfall accumulations over these bursts
        should be compared to the design rainfall estimates at the location of the rainfall gauge,
        without the application of the ARF, to estimate the AEP of the rainfall for each
        event.</para>
      <para>A sample of patterns for use in the Monte Carlo simulation should be selected from the
        set of historical events that are available. A sufficient number of events should be
        selected to allow for a meaningfully large sample in the Monte Carlo simulation. It is
        expected that a minimum of five patterns would be required each of the sets of spatial and
        temporal patterns. However, events should only be selected for inclusion in the sample if
        they are relatively similar in terms of the AEP of the rainfall to the range of AEP that
        design flood estimates are being produced. Ideally, the spatial patterns and temporal
        patterns of events selected for the Monte Carlo sample should have an estimated AEP that is
        between 1/10 and ten times the AEP of the design flood event to be simulated. Adding more
        historic spatial patterns to an ensemble does not necessarily improve the simulation
        accuracy of a Monte Carlo model, as the additional patterns that are most likely to be added
        would be at the more common end of the AEP range. In many catchments, design floods of
        interest are caused by rainfall events with a specific hydrometeorological mechanism, which
        is then associated with a range of space-time rainfall patterns that are different to those
        observed in rainfall events caused by more commonly occurring hydrometeorological
        conditions.</para>
      <para>Unless there is hydrometeorological evidence to the contrary, all potential spatial and
        temporal patterns in the sets available for sampling should be given equal probability of
        selection in the Monte Carlo simulation.</para>
      <para>After the spatial and temporal patterns for the design rainfall burst have been selected
        stochastically, the patterns should be scaled so that the catchment average rainfall depth
        for the design rainfall burst matches the depth generated stochastically by the sampling
        scheme.</para>
      <para>There has been limited assessment on methods for selection of space-time patterns for
        use in Monte Carlo simulation for design flood estimation. Further research should be
        conducted in this area to provide more robust guidance on the minimum number of temporal and
        spatial patterns in the sampling populations, the range of AEP represented by the
        populations of spatial and temporal patterns to be sampled compared to the AEP of the depth
        of the rainfall burst and the relative probabilities to be applied in the selection of
        spatial and temporal patterns.</para>

        Patterns</title>
      <para>The foregoing approach ignores the potential dependency that exists between the temporal

        sampling the space-time pattern for the event from a single population of space-time
        rainfall patterns over the catchment. The sample of space-time patterns may be assembled
        from space-time patterns of rainfall observed during historical rainfall events in the
        catchment. The space-time patterns should be assembled in accordance with the methods
        discussed in <xref linkend="b2_ch4_s_v5tqp"/>. The estimated catchment average depth for
        different burst durations within the event and the estimated rainfall event duration should
        be used with the table of design rainfall  estimates for the catchment, after application of
        the applicable ARF, to estimate the AEP of the rainfall for each event.</para>
      <para>It may be an option to transpose space-time rainfall patterns from an area with a good
        observational network for rainfall to a catchment with a poorer observational network. If
        this is done, the practitioner should only transpose (non-dimensional) space-time rainfall
        patterns from an area that is subject to rainfall events that are driven by similar
        hydrometeorological processes. The transposition region should be subject to similar
        orographic influences. In some cases, the space-time patterns may need to be rotated to
        maintain consistency between the spatial gradients in the space-time patterns and

      <para>The practitioner may be adopting a catchment model that allows for spatial distribution
        of the simulated rainfall sequence across the catchment. If this is the case, it is
        recommended that the generated sequence of rainfall is scaled for each portion of the model
        (subcatchment or grid cell as applicable to the particular model) to reflect the spatial
        distribution of rainfall that would be typically observed across the catchment. Parts of the
        catchment that are typically wetter would have rainfall depths applied in the model that are
        larger than the generated mean rainfall depth across the catchment but with the same timing
        and sequencing. Conversely, parts of the catchment that are typically drier would have
        rainfall depths applied in the model that are smaller than the generated mean rainfall depth
        across the catchment but with the same timing and sequencing.</para>
      <para>Selection of an appropriate means of deriving the spatial pattern for a continuous
        simulation model that includes spatial distribution depends upon the AEP of the design
        events that are of most interest and the flood response characteristics of the

            relation between antecedent rainfall and the annual maximum flood, it is recommended
            that the spatial pattern applied in the model should be estimated from contours of mean

    <title>Potential Influences of Climate Change on Areal Reduction Factors, Spatial and Space-Time

    <para>There is very little credible guidance on how climate change is projected to influence
      ARF, spatial patterns or space-time patterns of rainfall events used in design flood
      estimation. <citation>b1_c4_r1+1</citation> used dynamic downscaling using a regional climate
      model to identify that increases in rainfall intensity are likely to be greater in those areas
      of south-east Queensland that are subject to orographic enhancement than those areas that are
      not. There is insufficient evidence to confirm whether this projection is an artefact of the
      downscaling approach and whether it would still apply if the dynamic downscaling model were
      forced with Global Circulation Model results from the more recent
        <citation>b2_c4_r14+1</citation>. Even if it were proven for Southeast Queensland, it is not

    <para>It is recommended that until credible further studies are completed showing otherwise, for

    <title>Worked Examples</title>
    <para>All of the worked examples in this chapter use data for the Stanley River catchment, which
      is in the upper part of the Brisbane River basin in Southeast Queensland. Worked example 1
      demonstrates three different mathematical algorithms for estimating the spatial pattern of
      design rainfall for a particular rainfall event that occurred in January 2013. Worked examples
      2 through 4 demonstrate the process for design flood estimation, from calculation of ARF and
      catchment average design rainfall estimates (Worked example 2), through calculation of a
      representative spatial pattern (Worked example 3), to production of design flood estimates

        located in the southwestern corner. For this worked example, the Stanley River catchment is
        modelled using a runoff-routing model with 76 subcatchments, with subareas as shown in <xref
          linkend="b2_ch4_f_avrt3"/>.</para>
      <para>Design rainfall estimates are developed for the Stanley River at Woodford, which has a
        catchment area of 245 km<superscript>2</superscript>. The catchment to Woodford is the
        north-eastern portion of the catchment to Somerset Dam and for this worked example it
        includes fifteen subcatchments in the runoff-routing model.</para>
      <para>A significant feature of the Stanley River catchment is the appreciable gradient in
        rainfall that is typically observed during large rainfall events. Tropical cyclones,
        ex-Tropical Cyclones, East Coast Lows and other rainfall producing systems typically feed
        moisture into the catchment from the Pacific Ocean. Since the north-eastern part of the
        catchment is only 20 km from the coast but the western side of the catchment is almost 70 km
        from the coast, the typical direction of storm movement and typical direction of flow of
        warm moist air from the ocean results in a gradient of rainfall totals that reduce from east
        to west across the catchment in most rainfall events. The strength of the rainfall gradient
        is enhanced by orographic effects with the highest totals typically also occurring in the
        north-eastern part of the catchment.</para>

      <title>Worked Example 3: Calculation of Spatial Pattern for Design Flood Estimation</title>
      <para><xref linkend="b2_ch4_s_wxnds"/> recommends that estimation of design flood events of 1%
        AEP and more frequent, the spatial pattern for design event should be estimated using the
        spatial pattern derived from the  design rainfall grids across the catchment for the 1% AEP
        and for a duration that is anticipated to correspond to the duration of the rainfall burst
        that is likely to be critical at the specified location.</para>
      <para>For the Stanley River catchment, this approach was demonstrated using the 24 hour
        duration IFD data. For the catchment to Woodford, point rainfall depths at each of the
        subcatchment centroids were divided by the weighted average of the point rainfall depths to
        derive the non-dimensional spatial pattern, as computed in <xref linkend="b2_ch4_t_nehhn"/>
        and mapped in the top panel of <xref linkend="b2_ch4_f_l3qvp"/>. To model the 1% AEP 24 hour
        design flood event for the catchment, the non-dimensional spatial pattern was multiplied by
        the catchment average design rainfall depth to Woodford for this duration (468.6 mm, after
        application of the ARF), as computed in <xref linkend="b2_ch4_t_nehhn"/> and mapped in the

      <title> Deriving Spatial and Space-Time Patterns of Rainfall for Events</title>
      <para>The capacity to collect and archive remotely sensed rainfall estimates and to provide
        that information to practitioners is growing. It is recommended that the Bureau of
        Meteorology continues to invest in routinely archiving remotely sensed rainfall data,
        particularly from its network of ground based weather radars. It is recommended that the
        Bureau of Meteorology continues to expand the provision of quality controlled and bias
        corrected space-time rainfall estimates to practitioners, for use across the industry. It is
        recommended that tools should be further developed and disseminated to practitioners to
        facilitate the use of remotely sensed rainfall data.</para>
      <para>It is recommended that further research is conducted into quality control of remotely
        sensed estimates of the space-time pattern of rainfall.</para>
      <para>It is recommended that further research is conducted to improve methods for mean field
        bias correction of remotely sensed rainfall data. The recommendations on the approaches that
        should be adopted for mean field bias correction should be updated in these guidelines in
        accordance with the findings from this research.</para>
      <para>At the time of writing, there was not an agreed optimum method for deriving space-time
        rainfall patterns from rainfall gauge data for Australian catchments, although
          <citation>b2_c4_r39+1</citation> provide reasonable guidance. It is recommended that
        further research is conducted to identify a superior method (or set of potential methods)
        that are demonstrated to reliably produce more accurate estimation of the space-time
        rainfall field from gauge observations. It may be that the optimum method depends upon
        meteorological characteristics of the storm, density of rainfall gauges, orographic
        characteristics of the region or other factors. It is recommended that further research is
        conducted to explore these influences on the selection of optimum spatial and space-time
        interpolation methods for flood model calibration and design flood estimation.</para>

    <section>
      <title> Space-Time Patterns for Calibration of Rainfall Runoff Models to Historical
        Floods</title>
      <para>As discussed in <xref linkend="b2_ch4_s_vmrah"/>, the calibrated parameter values for a
        rainfall runoff model for a particular flood event may be sensitive to the method used to
        derive the space-time rainfall field for the event, particularly where the field is
        interpolated from a network of rain gauges only. It is recommended that further research is
        conducted into the sensitivity of rainfall-runoff routing model parameter estimation to
        assumptions made in the process of estimating the space-time rainfall field gauged rainfall
        data.</para>
    </section>
    <section>
      <title> Spatial and Space-Time Patterns for Design Flood Estimation</title>
      <para>It is recommended that further research is conducted into hydrometeorological drivers
        for space-time rainfall patterns that lead to flood events across different regions of
        Australia. The research should be used to inform practitioners on how they may choose
        between the space-time patterns of rainfall from different historical rainfall events to
        form the populations of space-time, spatial and temporal patterns in design flood simulation
        schemes. Research may investigate seasonal influences on space-time patterns of rainfall for
        use in design flood estimation.</para>
      <para>There has been limited assessment on methods for selection of space-time patterns for
        use in Monte Carlo simulation schemes for design flood estimation. Further research should
        be conducted in this area, to provide more robust guidance on:</para>

      <para>It is recommended that further research is conducted into the validity of transposing
        space-time patterns from one location to another. The research should assist in defining
        valid regions over which transposition of space-time patterns is acceptable and conversely
        boundaries between regions over which transposition should not occur. The research should
        also consider other aspects of transposition, such as the validity or otherwise of rotating
        space-time patterns and the maximum recommended angles for rotation.</para>
      <para>Further research should be conducted into methods for stochastic generation of
        space-time rainfall patterns. The research should investigate how orographic influences
        should be incorporated into the stochastic generation algorithms in a way that replicates
        the space-time variability of rainfall observed in historic rainfall events. Research should
        also develop more definitive guidance on appropriate statistical tests to demonstrate that
        the stochastically generated space-time rainfall patterns replicate the space-time
        statistical characteristics of historical rainfall events that are sufficiently large to
        have caused flood events.</para>

      <title> Potential Influences of Climate Variability and Climate Change</title>
      <para>Climatic variability at inter-decadal scales is likely to influence the relative
        occurrence and severity of different types of heavy rainfall events. Hydrometeorological
        understanding of the connection between storm types and ARFs may enable predictions of the
        future trend in ARFs that will occur as the climate changes over coming decades.
        Hydrometeorological understanding of the connection between storm types and space-time
        rainfall patterns may also allow for more accurate guidance to practitioners on the
        potential changes in space-time patterns that is predicted as a result of climate
        change.</para>
