    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>Obtaining an estimated rainfall depth for a specified probability is an essential
      component of the design of infrastructure including gutters, roofs, culverts, stormwater
      drains, flood mitigation levees, retarding basins and dams.</para>

    <para>If sufficient rainfall records are available, at-site frequency
    analysis can be undertaken to estimate the rainfall depth corresponding to
    the specified design probability in some cases. However, limitations
    associated with the spatial and temporal distribution of recorded rainfall
    data necessitates the estimation of design rainfalls for most
    projects.</para>

    <para>The purpose of this chapter is to outline the processes used to derive temporally and
      spatially consistent design rainfalls for Australia by the Bureau of Meteorology. The classes
      of design rainfall values for which estimates have been developed are described in <xref
        linkend="b2_ch3_s2_0"/>. The practitioner is advised that this chapter uses different
      frequency descriptors (<xref linkend="b2_ch3_t1"/>) used to describe events to other the rest
      of this Guideline (which use <xref linkend="arr_pref_term_table"/>). </para>

    <para><xref linkend="b1_ch6"/> summarises the current recommendations on how climate change
      should be incorporated into design rainfalls for those situations where the design life of the
      structure means that it could be affected by climate change.</para>

    <para><xref linkend="b2_ch3_s4_0"/> summarises the steps involved in deriving the frequent and
      infrequent design rainfalls (also known as the Intensity Frequency Duration (IFD) design
      rainfalls) for Australia. <xref linkend="b2_ch3_s5_0"/> and <xref linkend="b2_ch3_s6_0"/>
      describe how the very frequent and rare design rainfalls were estimated. The methods adopted
      are only briefly outlined in these sections, with additional references provided to facilitate
      access to further technical information for interested readers. More detail on each of the
      methods is provided in <citation>b2_c3_r9+1</citation>.</para>

    <para>In <xref linkend="b2_ch3_s7_0"/> a summary of the methods adopted
    for the estimation of Probable Maximum Precipitation is provided. <xref
    linkend="b2_ch3_s8_0"/> provides information on the uncertainties
    associated with the design rainfalls and <xref linkend="b2_ch3_s9_0"/>
    explains how to access estimates of each of the design rainfall
    classes.</para>

    <title>Design Rainfall Concepts</title>

    <para>Design rainfalls are a probabilistic or statistically-based estimate of the likelihood of
      a specific rainfall depth being recorded at a particular location within a defined duration.
      This is generally classified by an Annual Exceedance Probability (AEP) or Exceedances per Year
      (EY) (as defined in <xref linkend="b1_ch2_s_n6pll"/>). Design rainfalls are therefore not real
      (or observed) rainfall events; they are values that are probabilistic in nature.</para>

    <para>There are five broad classes of design rainfalls that are currently used for design
      purposes, generally categorised by frequency of occurrence. These are summarised below and
      presented graphically in <xref linkend="b2_ch3_f0"/>. However, it should be noted that there
      is some overlap between the classes. Different methods and data sets are required to estimate
      design rainfalls for the different classes and these are discussed in the following sections.
      The practitioner is advised that this chapter uses different frequency descriptors (<xref
        linkend="b2_ch3_t1"/>) used to describe events to other the rest of this Guideline (which
      use <xref linkend="arr_pref_term_table"/>). </para>

    <title>Climate Change Impacts</title>
    <para>The design rainfalls provided as part of these guidelines are based on observed rainfall
      data that represent, primarily, the climate of the 20th century. In order to assess the impact
      of future climates an adjustment must be made to the design rainfalls provided in this
      chapter. As part of the ARR revision projects a summary of the scientific understanding of how
      projected changes in the climate may alter the behaviour of factors that influence the
      estimation of the design floods was undertaken. Climate change research undertaken as part of
      the ARR revision projects has lead to an interim recommendation to factor the design rainfalls
      based on temperature scaling using temperature projections from the CSIRO future climates
      tool. Advice on how to adjust design rainfalls for climate change is detailed in <xref

      <title>Overview</title>
      <para>This section summarises the steps involved in deriving frequent and infrequent designs
        rainfalls (Intensity Frequency Duration (IFDs)) for the probabilities from 1EY to 1% AEP.
        These classes of design rainfalls constitute the traditional IFD design rainfalls (<xref
          linkend="b2_ch3_t1"/> ). The main steps involved in the derivation of the frequent and
        infrequent design rainfalls include the collation of a quality controlled database,
        extraction of the extreme values series, frequency analysis, regionalisation and gridding
        processes. These steps are discussed in more detail in <xref linkend="b2_ch3_s4_2"/> to
          <xref linkend="b2_ch3_s4_5"/> and summarised in  <xref linkend="b2_ch3_f_1"/> and in <xref

      <para>Integral to the estimation of design rainfalls was the creation of a database containing

        <para>The rainfall database used for the estimation of the design rainfalls included
          rainfall data collected at rainfall stations operated by organisations around Australia.
          There were two main sources of data; the Australian Data Archive for Meteorology and
          Australian Water Resources Information System (more detail on these data sources can be
          found in <xref linkend="b1_ch4_s_6l32u"/>). </para>
        <para>Rainfall data collected by the Bureau of Meteorology are stored in the Australian data
          Archive for Meteorology (ADAM) which contains approximately 20 000 daily read rainfall
          stations (both open and closed) starting in 1800; and nearly 1500 continuous rainfall
          stations – using both DINES and TBRG instrumentation.</para>
        <para>Under the terms of the Water Regulations 2008, water information (including rainfall
          data) collected by organisations across Australia are required to be provided to the
          Bureau of Meteorology. The rainfall data collected by organisations including local and
          state government water agencies, hydropower generators and urban water utilities are
          stored in the Australian Water Resources Information System (AWRIS) together with other
          water information. At present, AWRIS contains:</para>

        <title>Stationarity Assessment</title>

        <para>The quality controlled database that was established contained rainfall data for the
          period extending from the 1800s to the present. However, if climate change has caused
          non-stationarity in the recorded rainfalls, then possibly only a portion of the observed
          record should have been used in deriving the design rainfalls. This is because a key
          assumption in the statistical methods adopted for the derivation of the design rainfalls
          is that the data are stationary. In order to determine whether the complete period of
          available rainfall records could be adopted in estimating the design rainfalls, it was
          necessary to assess the degree of non-stationarity present in the historic record at
          rainfall stations across Australia <citation>b2_c3_r11</citation>.</para>

        <para>Two methods were used to establish if there are trends in the Annual Maximum Series of
          rainfalls for Australia. The first examined the records at individual stations which were
          tested to assess trends in the time series of the annual maximum rainfalls and changes in
          the probability distributions fitted to the annual maxima to estimate design rainfall
          quantiles. The second method used an area averaged approach to check for regional trends
          in the number of exceedances of pre-determined thresholds. The approach was based on that
          carried out by <citation>b2_c3_r5+1</citation> to assess trends in large rainfall events
          in the USA as part of the revisions by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
          to design rainfalls.</para>

        <para>It was concluded that although some stations showed strong
        trends in the annual maximum time series, particularly for short
        durations and more frequent events, the magnitude of these changes was
        within the expected accuracy of the fitted design rainfall
        relationships. It was therefore considered appropriate to assume
        stationarity and use the complete period of record at all stations in
        the estimation of the design rainfalls.</para>

      <title>Extraction of Extreme Value Series</title>

      <para>Rainfall frequency analysis was an integral part of the estimation
      of the design rainfalls as it enabled rainfall depths corresponding to a
      probability quantile to be ascertained. In estimating the frequent and
      infrequent design rainfalls it is large rainfalls that were being
      considered and therefore it was the extreme value series that was of
      interest.</para>

      <para>The extreme value series can be defined using the Annual Maximum Series (AMS) or the
        Partial Duration Series (PDS) (also known as Peak over Threshold) (more information can be
        found in <xref linkend="b3_ch2"/>). For the frequent and infrequent design rainfalls, the
        AMS was used to define the extreme value series because of its lack of ambiguity in defining
        the series; its relatively simple application and the problem of bias associated with the
        PDS for less frequent AEPs.</para>

      <para>It should be noted that in extracting the AMS, the focus was on obtaining the largest
        rainfall depth in each year for each of the durations considered. Therefore the extracted
        depths comprised both total storm depths and bursts within storms.</para>

      <para>In order to reduce the uncertainty in the design rainfall
      estimates, minimum station record lengths were adopted. The criteria
      were:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>30 or more years of record for daily read rainfall stations; and</para>
        </listitem>

          <para>More than 8 years of record for continuous rainfall stations.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>These criteria were selected on the basis of optimising the
      spatial coverage of the rainfall stations while ensuring that there were
      sufficient AMS values at each site to undertake frequency
      analysis.</para>

      <para>The daily read rainfall data are for the restricted period from 9:00 am to 9:00 am
        rather than for the actual duration of the event. As this may not lead to the largest
        rainfall total, it was necessary to convert these ‘restricted’ daily read rainfall depths to
        unrestricted rainfall depths. In order to do this, ‘restricted’ to unrestricted conversions
        factors were estimated using co-located daily read and continuous rainfall gauges at a
        number of locations around Australia of differing climatic conditions. The resultant factors

        <title>At-Site Frequency Analysis</title>

        <para>In order to assess the most appropriate distribution to adopt across Australia for the
          AMS, a range of distributions was trialled using single site analysis. Five distributions
          – Generalised Extreme Value (GEV), Generalised Logistic (GLO), Generalised Normal (GNO),
          Log Pearson III (LP III) and Generalised Pareto (GPA) – were fitted to the AMS extracted
          from the available long-term continuous rainfall stations for a range of durations. The
          goodness of fit of each distribution was assessed using the approach recommended by
            <citation>b2_c3_r21+1</citation>. It was found that the Generalised Extreme Value (GEV)
          distribution produced the best fit to the AMS on an at-site analysis. The comparison of
          distributions was subsequently repeated for regional estimates with the same results

        <title>Estimation of L-moments</title>

        <para>The linear combinations of the data (L-moments) <citation>b2_c3_r21</citation> of
          mean, variation (L-CV) and skewness (L-Skewness) were used to summarise the statistical
          properties of the extreme value series data at each station location. L-moments are
          commonly used in rainfall and Flood Frequency Analysis <citation>b2_c3_r21</citation> due
          to their efficiency in fitting the data and lack of bias in the sample estimates,
          particularly in the higher order moments, when compared to ordinary moments.</para>

        <para>While for durations of one day and longer this was a fairly straightforward approach,
          for sub-daily durations the scarcity of long-term continuous rainfall records meant that
          an alternative approach was needed to supplement the available data. For the IFD revision
          project, a Bayesian Generalised Least Squares Regression (BGLSR) approach was adopted, a
          summary of which is provided in <xref linkend="b2_ch3_s_wvl74"/>; more details can be

          <para>For daily read rainfall stations with 30 or more years of record, the mean, L-CV and

          <title>Sub-Daily Durations – at Continuous Rainfall Stations</title>
          <para>For continuous rainfall stations with more than eight years of record, the mean,
            L-CV and L-Skewness, were determined from the at-site extreme value series for each
            duration.</para>
          <para>The spatial coverage of sub-daily rainfall stations is considerably less than that
            of the daily read stations (refer to <xref linkend="b2_ch3_f3"/> and <xref
              linkend="b2_ch3_f4"/> ). Therefore, a method was needed to improve the spatial
            coverage of the sub-daily data. This is most commonly done using information from the
            daily read stations with statistics of sub-daily data being inferred from those of the
            daily data. Previously, adopted techniques for predicting rainfall depths at durations
            below 24 hours from those for the 24, 48 and 72 hour durations have been factoring of
            the 24 hour IFDs; principal component analysis followed by regression; and Partial Least
            Squares Regression. However, a major weakness of these previously adopted approaches is
            their inability to account for variation in record lengths from site to site and
            inter-station correlation.</para>
          <para>The approach adopted for the frequent and infrequent design rainfalls was Bayesian
            Generalised Least Squares Regression (BGLSR) as it accounts for possible
            cross-validation and unequal variance between stations by constructing an error
            co-variance matrix and can explicitly account for sampling uncertainty and inter-site
            dependence. Details of the BGLSR approach can be found in
              <citation>b2_c3_r36+1</citation>, <citation>b2_c3_r30+1</citation> and
              <citation>b2_c3_r31+1</citation>. In Australia, <citation>b2_c3_r18+1</citation> used
            BGLSR to obtain regional relationships to estimate peak streamflow in ungauged
            catchments and for pilot studies for the design rainfall project

          <para>The aim of the BGLSR is to predict sub-daily rainfall statistics at the location of

            the statistical properties of the AMS data <citation>b2_c3_r21</citation> because
            L-moments are relatively robust against outliers in the datasets. The statistics that

          <para>These three statistics can then be used to define the
          parameters of any appropriate probability distribution which in the

          <para>The initial work required to apply the BGLSR was to determine the appropriate

          <para><citation>b2_c3_r19+1</citation> provide extensive details of the cross-validated
            predictor selection process for each of the study areas. It was found that the most
            important predictor is the 24 hour rainfall statistic. However performance of the model
            was not changed significantly by including all predictors so this approach was
            adopted.</para>

          <para>As well as determining the optimum combination of predictor variables, the testing
            for the BGLSR needed to determine the number of stations to contribute to each
            regression equation. Ideally, the number of stations in each analysis area would be
            maximised to improve the accuracy of the regression equations. However the number of
            stations is limited to approximately 100 by the requirement for the error co-variance
            matrices to be invertible. The delineation of the analysis areas thus needed to balance
            these two competing requirements.</para>

          <para>It was also important that stations were grouped into analysis areas where the
            causative mechanisms for large rainfall events are similar. The rainfall stations were
            grouped primarily according to climatic zones by considering the seasonality of rainfall
            events and mean annual rainfalls. Australian drainage divisions were also used to guide
            the division of larger climatic zones into smaller areas over which the BGLSR
            calculations are tractable, such as in the northern tropics where three analysis areas
            have been adopted (NT, GULF and NORTH_QLD). The final analysis areas are shown in <xref
              linkend="b2_ch3_f10"/>. The South East Coast and South Western WA areas are considered
            Regions of Interest. A 0.2 degree buffer has been used in assigning stations to each
            analysis area to provide a smooth transition between adjacent areas.</para>

          <para>For each analysis area, a regression relationship was developed which could be
            applied to all stations within the analysis area. Where the density of stations was
            high, a Region Of Influence (ROI) approach <citation>b2_c3_r10</citation> was adopted
            such that each station has its own ROI. This allowed the regression equations to
            smoothly vary across the data dense analysis areas. For sparser analysis areas, a
            clustering, or fixed region, approach was adopted such that stations were grouped by
            spatial proximity into analysis areas with rigid boundaries. All stations in each
            analysis area were used to derive one regression equation that was then adopted for the
            predictions at those stations.</para>

          <figure xml:id="b2_ch3_f10">
            <title>Analysis Areas Adopted for the BGLSR</title>

          <para>To improve the predictions from the BGLSR it was desirable that the distribution of
            each predictor variable was relatively symmetric and preferably approximately normally
            distributed. For each analysis area the distribution of the predictor variables from all
            sites in the area were examined using histograms and quantile-quantile plots. For
            predictors that appeared to be strongly skewed, a range of transformations were trialled
            to attempt to reduce the skewness of the variable. The transformations included a
            natural logarithm, square root transformation and Box-Cox (i.e. power) transformation.
            In general the log transformation and the Box-Cox transformation were successful in
            reducing the skewness of the predictors.</para>

          <para>After determining the regression coefficients for the analysis areas, these
            coefficients were combined with the set of predictors for the daily station locations to
            produce the estimates of the sub-daily rainfall statistics. There are no observations of
            the sub-daily rainfall statistics to which these predictions at daily sites can be
            compared. However “sanity” checks on the values were carried out by comparing the
            estimates to the 24 hour rainfall statistics and to the possible range of values for
            L-CV and L-Skewness (both limited to -1 to 1).</para>

          <para>The result of using estimated sub-daily rainfall statistics
          was that the number of locations with sub-daily information was
          increased from approximately 2300 to approximately 9700 when both
          the daily and continuous rainfall stations locations are used. This
          substantially increased density of sub-daily rainfall data assisted
          in the subsequent gridding of the rainfall quantiles across
          Australia described in <xref linkend="b2_ch3_s4_5"/>.</para>

      <title>Regionalisation</title>

      <para>Regionalisation recognises that for stations with short records,
      there is considerable uncertainty when estimating the parameters of
      probability distributions and short records can bias estimates of
      rainfall statistics. To overcome this, it is assumed that information
      can be combined from multiple stations to give more accurate estimates
      of the parameters of the extreme value probability distributions. One
      approach that is widely used to reduce the uncertainty and overcome bias
      in estimating rainfall quantiles is regional frequency analysis, also
      known as regionalisation.</para>

      <para>For the design rainfalls, regionalisation was used to estimate the L-CV and L-Skewness
        with more confidence. The regionalisation approach adopted is generally called the “index
        flood procedure” <citation>b2_c3_r21</citation>. This approach assumes that sites can be
        grouped into homogenous regions, such that all sites in the region have the same probability
        distribution, other than a scaling factor. The scaling factor is termed the index flood or
        in this case, since the regionalisation is of rainfall data, the “index rainfall”. The index
        rainfall is the mean (that is, first L-moment) of the extreme value series data at the
        station location.</para>

      <para>The homogenous regions for the frequency analysis can be defined in a number of ways.
        Cluster and partitioning methods divide the set of all stations into a fixed number of
        homogenous groups <citation>b2_c3_r21</citation> where generally every site is assigned to
        one group. Alternatively, a ROI approach <citation>b2_c3_r10</citation> can be adopted, such
        that for each station an individual homogenous region is defined. Each ROI will contain a
        potentially unique set of sites, with each site possibly contributing to multiple
        ROIs.</para>

      <para>For the design rainfalls, the station point estimates were
      regionalised using a ROI as the advantage of this approach is that the
      region sizes can be easily varied according to station density and the
      available record lengths. The assumptions of the approach are, firstly,
      that the specified probability distribution (GEV in the case of the AMS)
      is appropriate; that the region is truly homogenous; and, finally, that
      sites are independent or that their dependence is quantified.</para>

      <para>In the application of the ROI method, it was first necessary to
      establish how big the ROIs should be. The size of the ROI can be defined
      in two ways; either using the number of stations included in the region
      or alternatively by calculating the total number of station-years in the
      region as the sum of the record lengths of the individual stations
      included in the ROI.</para>

      <para>Region sizes from 1 to 50 stations and from 50 to 5000 station-years were investigated
        to establish the optimum ROIs for estimating rainfall quantiles across Australia using a
        simple circular ROI and the Pooled Uncertainty Measure (PUM) <citation>b2_c3_r29</citation>.
        The minimum PUM values occur where there is an optimum size in the trade-off between bias
        and variance of generally lead to the minimum PUM value. When considering the region defined
        using the number of stations it was found that a region of 8 stations performed best. Given
        that the average record length for stations used in the analysis was 66 years, a region of 8
        stations will have on average 528 years of data which is consistent with the region size
        using the station-year criteria. The findings were generally independent of rainfall event
        duration and frequency.</para>

      <para>Defining regions in terms of station-years is attractive as this
      approach can adapt to different station densities and station record
      lengths. Given the similar results from both methods, the station-years
      definition for the region size was adopted.</para>

      <para>After finalising the optimum region size, a number of geographic
      and non-geographic similarity measures were investigated as methods to
      define membership of each ROI. Three different alternatives for defining
      the ROIs using geographical similarity were investigated:</para>

      <para>The regionalisation process resulted in estimates of the GEV
      parameters at all station locations, which were combined with the mean
      of the extreme value series at that site to estimate rainfall quantiles
      for any required exceedance probability. However frequent and infrequent
      design rainfall estimates are required across Australia, not just at
      station locations and therefore the results of the analyses needed to be

        <para>For the design rainfalls, the software package ANUSPLIN <citation>b2_c3_r24</citation>
          was chosen to grid the GEV parameters so that frequent and infrequent design rainfall
          estimates are available for any point in Australia. ANUSPLIN applies thin plate smoothing
          splines to interpolate and smooth multi-variate data. The degree of smoothing of the
          fitted functions was determined through generalised cross-validation. The splines are
          fitted using three independent variables; latitude, longitude and elevation. The elevation
          scale was exaggerated by a factor of 100 to represent the importance that elevation has on
          precipitation patterns <citation>b2_c3_r23</citation>.</para>

        <title>Optimisation of Gridding</title>

        <para>In undertaking the gridding, a considerable number of iterations was required to
          achieve an optimum outcome that represented the observed rainfalls but which did not place
          too much significance on short rainfall records or from poorly located rainfall stations.
          The appropriate degree of smoothing of the fitted functions was determined through
          generalised cross-validation with the number of knots and transformation adopted varied to
          achieve optimal results. In addition to the statistical tests to determine the appropriate
          degree of smoothing, qualitative assessments were also conducted by preparing maps which
          compared the index rainfall derived from at-site frequency analysis of rainfall records,
          the length of record available at each station, and the spatial density of the rainfall
          gauge network to the gridded index rainfalls produced by ANUSPLIN for daily
          durations.</para>

      <title>Overview</title>

      <para>The previous section summarised the steps involved in deriving the
      frequent and infrequent design rainfall values (IFDs) for probabilities
      from 1EY to 1% AEP. This range of probabilities is suitable for most
      design situations, however, many stormwater quality or Water Sensitive
      Urban Design guidelines recommend a flow threshold of
      Q<subscript>3month</subscript> for the design of stormwater quality
      treatment devices.</para>

      <para>Design rainfalls for the three month Average Recurrence Interval (or 4 EY) have not been
        previously available, with agencies giving their own advice on the approach for estimating
        very frequent design rainfalls. To address this need, estimates for probabilities more
        frequent than 1 EY have been derived.</para>

      <para>To ensure consistency between the very frequent design rainfalls and the frequent and
        infrequent design rainfall, the overall approach adopted for the very frequent design
        rainfalls was very similar to that adopted for the frequent and infrequent design rainfall.
        However, some modifications to the approach were necessary because of the increased
        frequency of occurrence that was being considered. A summary of the method is presented in
          <xref linkend="b2_ch3_t6"/> and in <xref linkend="b2_h3_s5_2"/> to <xref

      <title>Extraction of Extreme Value Series</title>

      <para>A Partial Duration Series (PDS) approach was adopted to estimate probabilities for
        events occurring more frequently than once a year. The advantage of using the PDS is that it
        extracts as much information as possible about large events and produces more accurate
        estimates for very frequent probabilities. As a PDS was used for the at-site series the
        selection of independent events was based on rank rather than temporal periods, thus
        completeness of record was not a consideration.</para>

      <para>As a PDS approach was being adopted it was necessary to define the
      threshold above which all events will be included. It was important to
      identify the number of values per year that are required to accurately
      estimate the more frequent IFD's. Given that the most frequent
      probability is 12 EY, a minimum of 12 events per year was used to
      adequately represent the at-site distribution for these higher frequency
      events.</para>

      <para>An assumption of the method, is that the events in the PDS are independent. In order to
        ensure that the events in the PDS were independent, a method that provided a consistent and
        meteorologically rigorous approach to defining independence of rainfall events across
        Australia was developed. The event independence testing criteria used were based on the
        Minimum Inter-event Time (MIT) approach <citation>b2_c3_r46</citation>. The analyses
        suggested that a MIT that varied from two to six days with latitude across Australia was
        appropriate for event durations up to three days while, for durations longer than three days
        the MIT adopted was zero. For durations of less than one day, the MIT for the one day
        duration was adopted <citation>b2_c3_r15</citation>.</para>

      <section xml:id="b2_ch3_s_66ri1">
        <title>At-Site Frequency Analysis</title>

        <para>The approach adopted effectively treated the PDS as a Monthly Partial Duration Series
          or, more correctly for the current dataset, a Monthly Exceedance Series (MES) (PDS where
          number of values = number of effective months: 12 nE). While the extracted PDS is the
          same, the averaging duration is changed, representing the time in months rather than
          years. The selection of an MES rather than an annual series allowed significantly more
          records to be included from each site to establish the at-site rainfall distribution,
          capturing the more frequent rainfall patterns.</para>

        <para>As discussed in <xref linkend="b2_ch3_s4_3"/> and <citation>b2_c3_r14+1</citation>,
          testing of the most appropriate distribution to adopt for both the AMS and the PDS was
          undertaken as part of the derivation of the IFDs with results identifying the GEV
          distribution as the most appropriate for the AMS and the GPA distribution for the PDS.
          However, as a monthly exceedance data series was adopted for the very frequent design
          rainfalls there is some added uncertainty; to address this, a comparison was conducted of
          the GEV and GPA distributions. Twenty-four geographically distributed test sites with
          medium to long record lengths were selected for assessing the relative fit of the
          distributions to the at-site data. The test sites indicated that the GPA provides a closer
          fit to the site data in the majority of cases. On the basis of this, the very frequent
          design rainfalls used the GPA distribution fitted to the PDS for all stations which met
          the required record length.</para>

      <section xml:id="b2_ch3_s_drzv8">
        <title>Estimation of L-moments</title>

        <para>Regional frequency analysis was undertaken using L-moments extracted from each of the
          at-site frequency distributions for sub-daily and daily data. The L-moments were used to
          estimate the parameters of the selected GPA distribution. </para>

        <para>Extracting 12 independent events per year of record for the MES introduced the issue
          of zero values included in the PDS at some sites. This particularly occurred through the
          arid areas of central Australia to the west coast, where annual rainfall is highly
          variable and strong seasonality can occur. These areas have short wet seasons and can fail
          to have 12 rain events on average that are independent of one another for every year.
          However, given the previously defined minimum number of events being 12, these zero values
          events are considered as part of the distribution. To manage the occurrence of the zero
          values in the extreme value series, <citation>b2_c3_r21+1</citation> suggest using a
          ‘mixed distribution’ or more correctly a conditional probability adjustment that gives a
          probability of a zero value, and cumulative distribution for the non-zero values as seen
          in <xref linkend="b2_ch3_e8"/>

      <title>Ratio Method</title>

      <para>The parameters of the GPA distribution derived from the L-moments were used to calculate
        at-site quantiles. The parameters or quantiles could be gridded in a similar method to the
        frequent and infrequent design rainfalls and smoothed or rescaled to integrate them with the
        design rainfalls less frequent than 1 EY. Alternatively, as adopted, a ratio method was
        applied to derive the very frequent design rainfall estimates. A general ratio approach is
        currently used by various councils and authorities in Australia and internationally
          <citation>b2_c3_r22</citation>. It involves using the at-site data to determine the ratio
        of the various very frequent design rainfall values to either the 1 EY or 50% AEP gridded
        design rainfalls.</para>

      <para>The ratio method adopted involves estimating at-site quantiles, using the at-site 50%
        AEP as the reference values for the ratios and gridding the calculated ratios. The advantage
        of this approach and using the at-site 50% AEP, was that it allows for the spatial
        variability in the ratios. In addition, the ratio was generally a more accurate
        representation of the <emphasis role="italic">X</emphasis> EY to 50% AEP ratio since it was
        calculated from the same dataset and resulted in a smooth spatial pattern. Consistency was
        also inherent since the ratios would always decrease with increasing probability. Since the
        ratios were spatially consistent, the final very frequent design rainfall depths follow the
        frequent and infrequent 50% AEP depths closely. These depth estimates were calculated using
        the gridded ratios, and multiplying by the 50% AEP design rainfall.</para>

        for the daily dataset and 1000 knots for the sub-daily dataset. The 0.025 degree Digital

      <para>Unlike the derivation of very frequent, frequent and infrequent design rainfalls which
        are based on observed rainfall events that lie within the range of probabilities being
        estimated, rare design rainfalls are an extrapolation beyond observed events.  The longest

        required for probabilities much rarer than this. As a consequence it is difficult to
        validate the resultant rare design rainfalls and therefore the method adopted needs to be
        based on a qualitative assessment that the assumptions made in the method are reasonable and
        that the adopted approach is consistent with methods used to derive more frequent design
        rainfalls where the results can be validated.</para>
      <para>The method adopted for deriving the rare design rainfalls was based on the data and
        method adopted for the more frequent design rainfalls but places more weight on the largest

      <para>The AMS was extracted from all daily read rainfall stations with 60 or more years of

        the focus is on the largest recorded events.</para>
      <para>As discussed in <xref linkend="b2_ch3_s4_3"/>, the GEV distribution was adopted for AMS
        for the frequent and infrequent design rainfalls following extensive testing of a range of
        candidate distributions. On the basis of these trials and similar results found by

        distribution was adopted for the rare design rainfall analyses.</para>
      <para>In keeping with the approach adopted for the more frequent design rainfalls, the
        statistical properties of the at-site data were estimated and then translated into the

        frequent design rainfalls, for the rare design rainfalls LH-moments were adopted

      <title>Regionalisation</title>
      <para>For the rare design rainfalls, the ROI approach adopted for the IFDs was used to reduce
        the uncertainty in the estimated LH-moments by regionalising the station point estimates.
        While  500 station years was found to be an optimum pool size for the IFDs, because the rare
        design rainfalls are provided for probabilities up to 1 in 2000 AEP, the ROI needed to be
        increased. The tradeoff between gaining improved accuracy from a larger pool of data was
        that the assumption of homogeneity may not be satisfied. Testing was conducted to find the
        pool size that reduced uncertainty without introducing significant homogeneity, with a
        minimum of 2000 station years adopted. However, where necessary, the number of pooled
        station years was increased above this number to maximize the available record used, while
        ensuring homogeneity.</para>
      <para>The average LH-CV for each region was calculated using a weighted average of the LH-CV
        at all stations in the region, with the weights proportional to the station lengths. This
        was repeated for the LH-Skewness.</para>

      <title>Gridding</title>
      <para>The Index, regionalised LH-CV and LH-SK values for all durations and AEP's were gridded
        using the splining software ANUSPLIN <citation>b2_c3_r25</citation> that was adopted for the
        more frequent design rainfalls. To determine the most appropriate method to adopt for the
        gridding of the moments a range of tests was undertaken of combinations of different knot
        sets. The final case adopted was a spline that incorporated latitude, longitude and
        elevation using 3750 knots for the Index (as was adopted for the more frequent design
        rainfalls) and 2200 knots for the regionalised LH-CV and LH-SK values. The 0.025 degree
        Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of Australia was used to provide the elevation data which was
        the same as that used in the derivation of the frequent and infrequent grids
          <citation>b2_c3_r39</citation> . </para>
      <para>In order to provide consistent design rainfall estimates across all durations and
        probabilities, a suitable method was required to integrate the rare design rainfalls with
        the more frequent design rainfalls. After testing of various ‘anchor’ points, the rare
        design rainfalls were anchored to the more frequent design rainfalls at the 5% AEP as it was
