    <para>If sufficient rainfall records are available, at-site frequency

    <para>Design rainfalls are a probabilistic or statistically-based estimate of the likelihood of
      a specific rainfall depth being recorded at a particular location within a defined duration.<?oxy_insert_start author="retallick" timestamp="20160616T202757+1000"?>

      Design rainfalls are therefore not real (or observed) rainfall events; they are values that
      are probabilistic in nature.</para>

    <para>There are five broad classes of design rainfalls that are currently used for design
      purposes, generally categorised by frequency of occurrence. These are summarised below and
      presented graphically in <xref linkend="b2_ch3_f0"/>. However, it should be noted that there
      is some overlap between the classes. Different methods and data sets are required to estimate
      design rainfalls for the different classes and these are discussed in the following sections.<?oxy_insert_start author="retallick" timestamp="20160616T202915+1000"?>

          if climate change has caused non-stationarity in the recorded rainfalls, then possibly
          only a portion of the observed record should have been used in deriving the design
          rainfalls. This is because a key assumption in the statistical methods adopted for the
          derivation of the design rainfalls is that the data are stationary. In order to determine
          whether the complete period of available rainfall records could be adopted in estimating
          the design rainfalls, it was necessary to assess the degree of non-stationarity present in
          the historic record at rainfall stations across Australia

          of rainfalls for Australia. The first examined the records at individual stations which
          were tested to assess trends in the time series of the annual maximum rainfalls and
          changes in the probability distributions fitted to the annual maxima to estimate design
          rainfall quantiles. The second method used an area averaged approach to check for regional
          trends in the number of exceedances of pre-determined thresholds. The approach was based
          on that carried out by <citation>b2_c3_r5+1</citation> to assess trends in large rainfall
          events in the USA as part of the revisions by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric

          design rainfalls.</para>

        <para>It was concluded that although some stations showed strong
        trends in the annual maximum time series, particularly for short
        durations and more frequent events, the magnitude of these changes was
        within the expected accuracy of the fitted design rainfall
        relationships. It was therefore considered appropriate to assume
        stationarity and use the complete period of record at all stations in
        the estimation of the design rainfalls.</para>

      <para>Rainfall frequency analysis was an integral part of the estimation

      infrequent design rainfalls it is large rainfalls that were being

        For the frequent and infrequent design rainfalls, the AMS was used to define the extreme
        value series because of its lack of ambiguity in defining the series; its relatively simple
        application and the problem of bias associated with the PDS for less frequent AEPs.</para>

      <para>It should be noted that in extracting the AMS, the focus was on obtaining the largest
        rainfall depth in each year for each of the durations considered. Therefore the extracted
        depths comprised both total storm depths and bursts

      <para>These criteria were selected on the basis of optimising the
      spatial coverage of the rainfall stations while ensuring that there were
      sufficient AMS values at each site to undertake frequency
      analysis.</para>

            predictor selection process for each of the study areas. It was found that the most
            important predictor is the 24 hour rainfall statistic. However performance of the model
            was not changed significantly by including all predictors so this approach was
            adopted.</para>

          <para>As well as determining the optimum combination of predictor variables, the testing
            for the BGLSR needed to determine the number of stations to contribute to each
            regression equation.
            Ideally<?oxy_insert_start author="retallick" timestamp="20160619T171052+1000"?>,<?oxy_insert_end?>
            the number of stations in each analysis area would be maximised to improve the accuracy
            of the regression equations. However the number of stations is limited to approximately
            100 by the requirement for the error co-variance matrices to be invertible. The
            delineation of the analysis areas thus needed to balance these two competing
            requirements.</para>

          <para>It was also important that stations were grouped into analysis areas where the
            causative mechanisms for large rainfall events are similar. The rainfall stations were
            grouped primarily according to climatic zones by considering the seasonality of rainfall
            events and mean annual rainfalls. Australian drainage divisions were also used to guide
            the division of larger climatic zones into smaller areas over which the BGLSR
            calculations are tractable, such as in the northern tropics where three analysis areas

            examined using histograms and quantile-quantile plots. For predictors that appeared to
            be strongly skewed, a range of transformations were trialled to attempt to reduce the
            skewness of the variable. The transformations included a natural logarithm, square root
            transformation and Box-Cox

      <title>Regionalisation</title>

      <para>Regionalisation recognises that for stations with short records,
      there is considerable uncertainty when estimating the parameters of
      probability distributions and short records can bias estimates of
      rainfall statistics. To overcome this, it is assumed that information
      can be combined from multiple stations to give more accurate estimates
      of the parameters of the extreme value probability distributions. One
      approach that is widely used to reduce the uncertainty and overcome bias
      in estimating rainfall quantiles is regional frequency analysis, also
      known as regionalisation.</para>

      <para>For the design rainfalls, regionalisation was used to estimate the L-CV and L-Skewness
        with more confidence. The regionalisation approach adopted is generally called the “index
        flood procedure” <citation>b2_c3_r21</citation>. This approach assumes that sites can be
        grouped into homogenous regions, such that all sites in the region have the same probability
        distribution, other than a scaling factor. The scaling factor is termed the index flood or
        in this case, since the regionalisation is of rainfall data, the “index rainfall”. The index
        rainfall is the mean (that is, first L-moment) of the extreme value series data at the
        station location.</para>

      <para>The homogenous regions for the frequency analysis can be defined in a number of ways.
        Cluster and partitioning methods divide the set of all stations into a fixed number of
        homogenous groups <citation>b2_c3_r21</citation> where generally every site is assigned to
        one group. Alternatively, a ROI approach <citation>b2_c3_r10</citation> can be adopted, such
        that for each station an individual homogenous region is defined. Each ROI will contain a
        potentially unique set of sites, with each site possibly contributing to multiple
        ROIs.</para>

      <para>For the design rainfalls, the station point estimates were
      regionalised using a ROI as the advantage of this approach is that the
      region sizes can be easily varied according to station density and the
      available record lengths. The assumptions of the approach are, firstly,
      that the specified probability distribution (GEV in the case of the AMS)
      is appropriate; that the region is truly homogenous; and, finally, that
      sites are independent or that their dependence is quantified.</para>

      <para>In the application of the ROI method, it was first necessary to
      establish how big the ROIs should be. The size of the ROI can be defined
      in two ways; either using the number of stations included in the region
      or alternatively by calculating the total number of station-years in the
      region as the sum of the record lengths of the individual stations
      included in the ROI.</para>

      <para>Region sizes from 1 to 50 stations and from 50 to 5000 station-years were investigated
        to establish the optimum ROIs for estimating rainfall quantiles across Australia using a
        simple circular ROI and the Pooled Uncertainty Measure (PUM) <citation>b2_c3_r29</citation>.
        The minimum PUM values occur where there is an optimum size in the
        trade<?oxy_delete author="testoni" timestamp="20181122T113303+1100" content=" "?><?oxy_insert_start author="testoni" timestamp="20181122T113303+1100"?>-<?oxy_insert_end?>off
        between bias and variance of generally lead to the minimum PUM value. When considering the
        region defined using the number of stations it was found that a region of 8 stations
        performed best. Given that the average record length for stations used in the analysis was
        66 years, a region of 8 stations will have on average 528 years of data which is consistent
        with the region size using the station-year criteria. The findings were generally
        independent of rainfall event duration and frequency.</para>

      <para>Defining regions in terms of station-years is attractive as this
      approach can adapt to different station densities and station record
      lengths. Given the similar results from both methods, the station-years
      definition for the region size was adopted.</para>

      <para>After finalising the optimum region size, a number of geographic
      and non-geographic similarity measures were investigated as methods to
      define membership of each ROI. Three different alternatives for defining
      the ROIs using geographical similarity were investigated:</para>

        (PDS) approach was adopted to estimate probabilities for events occurring more frequently
        than once a year. The advantage of using the PDS is that it extracts as much information as
        possible about large events and produces more accurate estimates for very frequent
        probabilities. As a PDS was used for the at-site series the selection of independent events
        was based on rank rather than temporal periods, thus completeness of record was not a
        consideration.</para>

      <para>As a PDS approach was being adopted it was necessary to define the
      threshold above which all events will be included. It was important to
      identify the number of values per year that are required to accurately
      estimate the more frequent IFD's. Given that the most frequent
      probability is 12 EY, a minimum of 12 events per year was used to
      adequately represent the at-site distribution for these higher frequency
      events.</para>

          a Monthly Exceedance Series (MES) (PDS where number of values = number of effective
          months: 12 nE). While the extracted PDS is the same, the averaging duration is changed,
          representing the time in months rather than years. The selection of an MES rather than an
          annual series allowed significantly more records to be included from each site to
          establish the at-site rainfall distribution, capturing the more frequent rainfall
          patterns.</para>

          testing of the most appropriate distribution to adopt for both the AMS and the PDS was
          undertaken as part of the derivation of the IFDs with results identifying the GEV
          distribution as the most appropriate for the AMS and the GPA distribution for the PDS.
          However, as a monthly exceedance data series was adopted for the very frequent design
          rainfalls there is some added uncertainty; to address this, a comparison was conducted of
          the GEV and GPA distributions. Twenty-four geographically distributed test sites with
          medium to long record lengths were selected for assessing the relative fit of the
          distributions to the at-site data. The test sites indicated that the GPA provides a closer
          fit to the site data in the majority of cases. On the basis of this, the very frequent
          design rainfalls used the GPA distribution fitted to the PDS for all stations which met
          the required record length.</para>

        <para>Extracting 12 independent events per year of record for the MES introduced the issue
          of zero values included in the PDS at some sites. This particularly occurred through the
          arid areas of central Australia to the west coast, where annual rainfall is highly
          variable and strong seasonality can occur. These areas have short wet seasons and can fail
          to have 12 rain events on average that are independent of one another for every year.
          However, given the previously defined minimum number of events being 12, these zero values
          events are considered as part of the distribution. To manage the occurrence of the zero
          values in the extreme value series, <citation>b2_c3_r21+1</citation> suggest using a
          ‘mixed distribution’ or more correctly a conditional probability adjustment that gives a

        applied to derive the very frequent design rainfall estimates. A general ratio approach is

        gridding the calculated ratios. The advantage of this approach and using the at-site 50%

        to 50% AEP ratio since it was calculated from the same dataset and resulted in a smooth
        spatial pattern. Consistency was also inherent since the ratios would always decrease with
        increasing probability. Since the ratios were spatially consistent, the final very frequent
        design rainfall depths follow the frequent and infrequent 50% AEP depths closely. These
        depth estimates were calculated using the gridded ratios, and multiplying by the 50% AEP
